          <h1>GeoRiot Privacy Policy</h1>

          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>GeoRiot (“we” or “us”)
            provides a set of services (“Genius Link Services”) to
            commercial customers (“Clients”) for purposes of online
            marketing and sales of digital and physical products and services
            (“Products”) to individual consumers. The Genius Link
            Services are provided to Clients worldwide, including in the United
            States (“U.S.”), the member states of the European Union
            (“EU”), and Switzerland. The Genius Link Services are
            provided under the names “Genius Link” and
            “BookLinker.net.” The Genius Link Services are not
            provided to individuals as consumers.</p>
          <p>The Genius Link Services are dynamic
            links that are used to connect consumers visiting or interacting with
            a Client’s websites, applications, social media, electronic
            documents, eBooks, text messages and other online digital properties
            (“Digital Properties”) to retail websites (“Storefronts”)
            maintained by international goods and services retailers
            (“Retailers”) where Products identified on the Client’s
            Digital Property (“Products”) can be purchased. These
            dynamic links are called “Geni.us Links.” Digital
            Properties including Geni.us Links are accessed through a personal
            computer, laptop, smartphone or other device providing Internet
            access through a browser (“Device”) when an individual
            follows the Geni.us Link to a Storefront.</p>
          <p>GeoRiot collects information that is
            or can be associated with a particular individual (“Personal
            Information”) automatically when an individual using a Device
            clicks a Geni.us Link in the course of viewing and interacting with
            content on a Client’s Digital Properties (a “Transaction”).
            Such an individual is referred to as a “Buyer” in this
            Policy. GeoRiot also collects Personal Information automatically
            about individuals who navigate to and browse the GeoRiot’s
            website(s) (“Site Visitors”). Finally, GeoRiot collects
            Personal Information about individuals acting as or on behalf of
            Clients for purposes of the Genius Link Services (“Client
            Users”) in the course of Client account registration and in
            communications and transactions between the Client and GeoRiot. This
            Policy explains our data collection and privacy practices with
            respect to the Personal Information of Buyers, Site Visitors, and
            Client Users.</p>
          <h2>2. Adherence to the Standard Contractual Clauses
            and GDPR</h2>
          <p>GeoRiot’s and the Genius Link
            Services’ collection, use, and retention of personal
            information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom,
            and Switzerland to the United States in conducted in compliance with
            the Standard Contractual Clauses for Controllers as approved by the
            European Commission pursuant to Decision C(2004)5271 (the “SCCs”).
            If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the
            SCCs, the SCCs shall govern. To learn more about the SCCs, and to
            view the model agreement text, please visit
            https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/2004/915/oj.</p>
          <p>While not all data described as
            Personal Information in this Policy is necessarily within the scope
            of information covered by the SCCs and the GDPR, as a matter of
            prudence and due diligence and to help assure transparency, GeoRiot
            has elected to attest to its adherence to the SCCs regarding all
            Personal Information that it collects and maintains, as described in
            this Policy. GeoRiot has also implemented policies and procedures to
            assure its compliance with the EU General Data Protection Directive
            (“GDPR”) to the extent the GDPR applies to Personal
            Information.</p>
          <h2>3. Collection and Processing of Personal
            Information</h2>
          <p>Please note that GeoRiot does not
            provide any products or services to individuals acting in a personal
            capacity or engage in transactions or communications with them.
            GeoRiot only collects and uses information such as names, addresses
            or other contact information, governmental or corporate
            identification numbers, account numbers or images, or other
            information in connection with Client Users; and only collects and
            uses information such as user name or email address, IP address, or
            other information in connection with Site Users who post a comment on
            our blog. GeoRiot does not combine Personal Information with other
            data to identify individuals for purposes of the Genius Link
            Services.</p>
          <p>Information collected through
            Geni.us Links and information collected about Site Visitors and
            Client Users is transferred to and stored by GeoRiot in the United
            States, according to GeoRiot’s standard Data Retention
            policies. As a matter of due diligence and prudence, GeoRiot has
            taken appropriate measures to ensure the security, integrity and
            ethical use of the information that we collect.</p>
          <p><b>Buyers</b></p>
          <p>When a Buyer clicks a Geni.us Link
            the following information is collected automatically, as determined
            by the coding of the Geni.us Link by GeoRiot:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Information identifying the
                operating system and browser used by the Device for the Transaction
                (“User Agent Information”), including information
                identifying and describing the Device used for the Transaction
                (“Device Data”).</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>Information identifying the
                language used by the Device for the Transaction (“Language
                Information”).</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>The Internet Protocol (“IP”)
                address of the Device used for the Transaction, which allows
                identification of the logical and to some extent geographical
                location of the Device used in the Transaction (“Location
                Data”).</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>The URL of the Client’s
                Digital Property on which the originating Geni.us Link is sited
                (“Client URL”).</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>Product identification
                information for Products via the Geni.us Link the Device was used to
                click (“Product Information”).</p>
          </li></ul>
          <p>In addition, GeoRiot may collect the
            following information from third party sources:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Limited purchase information
                obtained by the Retailer in the event a Buyer purchases a Product in
                the course of a Transaction, such as the number of products
                purchased, a list of items (or categories of items), purchase
                prices, and timestamp of the Transaction (“Limited Purchase
                Information”).</p>
          </li></ul>
          <p>Geni.us Links may support the
            following uses of Personal Information, for the benefit of Clients:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><i>Dynamic Links.</i>&nbsp;A
                Client can use a single link to route Buyers to the appropriate
                Retailer website based on information such as the user’s
                location, device, and language set in the browser. This may include
                dynamic links on a Client’s Digital Property which
                automatically populate a Storefront customized for the Buyer on the
                Digital Property. For example, a Client website that reviews
                technology devices may display related products with links to
                purchase them on Retailer Amazon’s Storefront. The Geni.us
                Link may be used to ensure the Amazon link that appears on the
                Client’s website is directed appropriately based on the
                Buyer’s location.</p>
            </li><li>
              <p><i>Automatic Product
                Localization.</i>&nbsp;A Client can use a single link to
                automatically route Buyers to the appropriate Product in the Buyer’s
                local Storefront, such as the Amazon, iTunes, or Microsoft online
                stores. Automatic affiliation may be used to earn commissions from
                the correct local Retailer’s Storefront. For example, a Buyer
                in Germany may be sent to the Amazon Germany Storefront by a Geni.us
                Link from a Client website, and the Client might earn a commission
                through the Amazon Germany affiliate program.</p>
            </li><li>
              <p><i>Choice Pages.</i>&nbsp;A
                Client may use a link to provide a mobile-optimized landing page
                where a Buyer can view different buying options, rather than having
                an automated process pick for them.</p>
            </li><li>
              <p><i>Retargeting.</i>&nbsp;The
                Client may use a Geni.us Link to set pixels on behalf of the Client
                to enable collection of Client activity data by third-parties such
                as Facebook and Google.</p>
          </li></ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><i>Data Analytics.</i>&nbsp;The
                Data Analytics service provides Clients with marketing content based
                on data identifying the geographical location (“Location
                Data”), Device data, User Agent Data, Language Data and
                Transactions Data. The Data Analytics service helps Clients ensure
                that marketing efforts are relevant to the Buyer and appropriate to
                the country or region where the Buyer is located.</p>
          </li></ul>
          <p><b>Site Visitors</b></p>
          <p>When a Site Visitor navigates to and
            engages with the GeoRiot website, GeoRiot collects the following
            information automatically through external service providers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Interaction and usage data,
                including information about how you reached the website and your
                navigation of the website.</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>Information provided in
                connection with a comment posted on our blog, including your public
                Disqus account information or email address, Location Data, and the
                content of the post.</p>
          </li></ul>
          <p>GeoRiot uses this information for
            purposes of internal data analytics and first-party marketing and
            advertising, and to otherwise identify and communicate potential
            opportunities to promote GeoRiot to Site Visitors.</p>
          <p><b>Client Users</b></p>
          <p>When a Client creates a Genius Link
            account, the Client must provide GeoRiot with contact information for
            an individual user authorized to use the Genius Link Services and
            communicate with GeoRiot, either as an individual Client or on behalf
            of an organizational Client (“Client User”). This
            information may include Client User’s name, email addresses,
            and other contact information used to communicate with the Client
            User, the Client User’s IP address, as well as the content of
            communications between GeoRiot and the Client User and any
            transactions the Client User engages in with GeoRiot.</p>
          <p>GeoRiot may use such information to
            communicate with the Client User and with other individuals acting on
            behalf of the Client with respect to the Genius Link Services, and to
            otherwise ensure proper administration of the Genius Link Services
            (“Administrative Purposes”), and may use it to identify
            and communicate with respect to potential opportunities for the
            Client to obtain or use Genius Link Services from GeoRiot, or
            otherwise promote GeoRiot to the Client and Client User (“Marketing
            Purposes”). </p>
          <p>When a Client User engages with the
            GeoRiot website or the Genius Link platform, GeoRiot collects usage
            data automatically through external service providers.</p>
          <p><b>Cookies and Third-Party Tracking
            Technologies</b></p>
          <p>GeoRiot relies on partners to

          <h2>4. GeoRiot as Limited
            Data Controller and Data Processor</h2>
          <p>A “Data Controller” is a
            party which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes
            and means of the processing of personal data.</p>
          <p>To the extent the SCCs and the GDPR
            apply to Personal Information, for purposes of the Genius Link
            Services GeoRiot and the applicable Client are Joint Data Controllers
            of the Personal Information as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><a name="Bookmark"></a>GeoRiot
                offers Geni.us Links and the Genius Link Services to Clients, with
                pre-established coding and design which determine the information
                which is collected and the means by which information is processed.
                The Client determines whether to implement Geni.us Link and use the
                Genius Link Services, and by agreement with GeoRiot determines to
                utilize the information collection scope and processing means
                offered by GeoRiot. All Genius Link Services are provided for the
                benefit of the Client. The Client is therefore the Data Controller
                with respect to the determination of the scope of the information to
                be collected and the means of its processing.</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>The Client determines where to
                site Geni.us Link(s) in the Client’s Digital Properties, and
                the purpose(s) for which the information collected will be used
                (e.g., available Storefronts, implementation of routing
                alternatives, support for commissions, etc.). All Personal
                Information about Buyers is processed for the benefit of the Client.
                The Client is therefore the Data Controller with respect to the
                determination of siting of the Geni.us Link(s) and the purposes for
                which information is collected and processed.</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>GeoRiot determines the
                retention period for information collected via Geni.us Links.
                GeoRiot is therefore the Data Controller with respect to the
                retention of the Personal Information.</p>
          </li></ul>
          <p>For purposes of
            Personal Information collected about Site Visitors and Client Users,
            GeoRiot is Data Controller.</p>
          <h2>5. Provision of Notice to Buyers, Site Visitors,
            and Client Users</h2>
          <p>This Policy is published to provide
            notice of GeoRiot’s data collection and privacy practices to
            individuals, including Buyers, Site Visitors, and Client Users.
            GeoRiot interacts directly with Client Users in the course of account
            registration and communications and transactions with respect to the
            Genius Link Services. However, GeoRiot does not typically interact
            directly with individuals, since its presence on its Clients’
            Digital Properties is limited to the Geni.us Link(s) in/on the
            Client’s Digital Properties. GeoRiot therefore contractually
            requires its Clients to ensure their compliance with any legal
            requirements for notification to and consent by individuals with
            respect to their data collection and use practices, as required in
            their applicable jurisdictions.</p>
          <p><a name="Bookmark1"></a>In addition,
            GeoRiot contractually requires its Clients to comply with the Network
            Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct where it is applicable to
            their business. In particular, if a Client attempts to combine data
            about an individual from other sources with GeoRiot Personal
            Information, it is required to notify the affected individuals and
            obtain their opt-in consent in accordance with the NAI Code of
            Conduct. If a Client collects data for interest-based advertising, it
            is required to clearly and conspicuously post a notice consistent
            with the NAI Code that contains:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>A statement that data may be
                collected for interest-based advertising;</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>A description of types of data
                that are collected for interest-based advertising purposes;</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>An explanation of how, and for
                what purpose, the data collected will be used or transferred to
                third parties; and</p>
            </li><li>
              <p>A conspicuous link to an
                opt-out mechanism.</p>
          </li></ul>
          <h2>6. Collection of Information</h2>
          <p><b>Buyers</b></p>
          <p>GeoRiot principally collects
            information through transactions that occur as part of “Link
            Localization.” In this process a Geni.us Link which promotes or
            sells a product is posted on a Client’s Digital Property, and
            automatically points to a Retailer’s online Storefront
            designated by the Client. When a Buyer clicks the Geni.us Link,
            Personal Information is collected and transmitted to GeoRiot’s
            servers. This information is automatically analyzed to identify the
            location and type of Device being used to access the link. Based on
            this information, the Geni.us Link automatically redirects the Device
            to a web page in regional or country-specific storefront of the
            Retailer (“Localized Page”) which promotes or sells the
            product.</p>
          <p>GeoRiot does not create or
            administer either its Clients’ Digital Properties or Retailers’
            Storefront pages, does not provide content for either, and does not
            sell or promote products on either. The only information GeoRiot
            collects from either the Digital Property or the Storefront is that
            provided in response to the click on the Genius Link.</p>
          <p>GeoRiot may collect and process the
            following information from the Device used to click on the Geni.us
            Link:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><a name="_Hlk514509101"></a><a name="Bookmark2"></a> User Agent Information which identifies the Device, operating system
                and browser used by the Device in use. </p>
          </li></ul>

              <p>Location Information, which is
                the IP address of the Device used in the Transaction. The IP address
                provides network information, which can often be used to determine
                the country, state and sometimes city and postal code where the
                Device is in use. Location Information is treated as if it were
                Personal Information. However, GeoRiot typically deletes Location
                Information within five minutes of the click, and does not maintain

                categories of items), purchase prices, and timestamp of the
                Transaction (“Limited Purchase Information”). Limited
                Purchase Information is collected and provided to GeoRiot by
                Clients, who are responsible for ensuring that any individual
                consent or authorization required for its use by GeoRiot has been

          <p>GeoRiot does not collect any other

          <p>GeoRiot’s Genius Link Services
            are only offered with respect to individuals who are 18 years of age
            or older. GeoRiot does not knowingly collect or maintain any Personal
            Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no
            aspect of the Genius Link Services is designed to attract people
            under the age of 13. If GeoRiot obtains knowledge that a Buyer is
            under the age of 13, GeoRiot will remove Personal Information with
            respect to that individual from its databases.</p>
          <p><b>Site Visitors</b></p>
          <p>When a Site Visitor navigates to and

          </li></ul>
          <p><b>Client Users</b></p>
          <p>When a Client creates a GeoRiot
            account it must provide GeoRiot with contact information for
            individual users authorized to use the Genius Link Services and
            communicate with GeoRiot as or on behalf of a Client (“Client
            Users”). This information may include Client User name, email
            addresses, and potentially other information used to communicate with
            the Client User, as well as the content of communications between
            GeoRiot and the Client User and any transactions the Client User
            engages in with GeoRiot.</p>
          <p>When a Client User engages with the
            GeoRiot website or the Genius Link platform, GeoRiot collects usage
            data automatically through external service providers.</p>

          <p>Subject to
            Section 6(c), GeoRiot may retain Buyer, Site Visitor, and Client User
            Personal Information in the following manner:</p>
          <p>In accordance with our retention
            policies.</p>
          <p>For any period we determine is

          <p>IP addresses for Buyers are only
            processed during the initial click on a Geni.us Link and are not

          <p><b>Buyers</b></p>
          <p>The Personal Information GeoRiot
            maintains about Buyers after processing a Geni.us Link click is
            limited to User Agent Information, Language Information, Client URL,
            Product Information, and Limited Purchase Information. As noted
            above, GeoRiot typically deletes Location Information within 5
            minutes of the click, and does not maintain or store such data beyond
            that time period. Because GeoRiot lacks the ability to identify a
            particular Buyer in connection with any Personal Information that we
            store or maintain, we cannot offer Buyers any choices with respect to
            Personal Information.</p>

            that is subject to a Buyer’s disclosure opt-in in accordance
            with GeoRiot’s Data Retention Policy. The purpose of retaining
            such information is for GeoRiot’s internal management and
            administration or fulfillment of our legal responsibilities or

            the source of that information, the purposes for which we collect it,

            You also have the right to request in certain circumstances that we

            Users, who may submit requests to know/access or deletion as
            described below. To protect your Personal Information, GeoRiot is
            required to verify your identify before we can act on your request.
            We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with
            your request, or why we may comply with it in a more limited way than
            you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our
            response.</p>
          <p><strong>How to Submit a Request</strong></p>
          <p>You may submit a request to exercise

            through one of the following means:</p>

          <p><strong>Verification Procedures</strong></p>

            this by asking you to provide the email address(es) you previously
            contacted us with or the username assigned when creating your
            account, so we can match that data against information we may have
            collected from you previously</p>
          <p><a name="Bookmark5"></a><strong>Authorized
            Agent</strong></p>
          You may authorize another individual
            or a business registered with the California Secretary of State,
            called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf. GeoRiot
            requires that you and the individual complete affidavits in order to
            verify the identity of the authorized agent and confirm that you have
            authorized them to act on your behalf. Parents of minor children may
            submit a birth of the child certificate in lieu of an affidavit, in

            opt out of any sale of your Personal Information by GeoRiot to third
            parties. </p>
          <p>To “sell” information
            means to disclose it to a company for monetary or other benefit. A
            company may be considered a third party either because the purpose of
            sharing is not an enumerated business purpose under California law,
            or because our contract does not restrict them from using Personal
            Information for other purposes. </p>

            directly opting out of or blocking tracking by a vendor listed above
            in the subsection titled “Cookies and Third-Party Tracking
