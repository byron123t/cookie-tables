We use the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of personal information to us, and also for transfer of personal information to third-party service providers. These clauses require the recipients to protect the personal information they receive in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Details of our use of SCCs can be provided upon request.<br>
                                        - Derogations. In certain circumstances we may transfer personal information based on the decorations contained in Article 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br>
                                        - Supplementary Messages. In addition to the SCCs, we may use contractual, technical and organizational measures to further protect your personal information.<br>
