<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
