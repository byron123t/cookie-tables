Snagajob Properties are controlled and offered by Snagajob from its facilities in the United States of America.

Those who access or use Snagajob Properties from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">18.  <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong>  <strong><em>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Snagajob and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Us.  </em></strong></p><div>18.1  <strong><u>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</u></strong>  You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with Snagajob, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Snagajob may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). <strong> This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.  </strong></div><p dir="ltr"><strong>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH SNAGAJOB, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST SNAGJOB ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.  INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE SNAGAJOB IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.  IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">18.2  <strong><u>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</u></strong>  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Snagajob.com, Inc., c/o Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware, 19808 and/or e-mail <a href="mailto:legal@snagajob.com">legal@snagajob.com</a>.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>.  JAMS’s rules are also available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Snagajob will pay them for you.  In addition, Snagajob will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, Snagajob will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p><p dir="ltr">18.3  <strong><u>Authority of Arbitrator.</u></strong>  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snagajob.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).  The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  </p><p dir="ltr">18.4  <strong><u>Waiver of Jury Trial.</u></strong>  YOU AND SNAGAJOB HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Snagajob are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 18.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  </p><p dir="ltr">18.5  <strong><u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</u></strong>  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Sections 19.6 and 19.7.</p><p dir="ltr">18.6  <strong><u>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</u></strong>  You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Snagajob, 4851 Lake Brook Drive, Glen Allen, VA 23060, Attention: Legal or e-mail <a href="http://legal@snagajob.com">legal@snagajob.com</a> within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Snagajob.com, Inc., c/o Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware, 19808 and/or e-mail <a href="mailto:legal@snagajob.com">legal@snagajob.com</a>.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>.  JAMS’s rules are also available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Snagajob will pay them for you.  In addition, Snagajob will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, Snagajob will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p><p dir="ltr">18.3  <strong><u>Authority of Arbitrator.</u></strong>  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snagajob.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).  The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.

An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  </p><p dir="ltr">18.5  <strong><u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</u></strong>  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

Snagajob Properties are controlled and offered by Snagajob from its facilities in the United States of America. Snagajob makes no representations that Snagajob Properties are appropriate or available for use in other locations.  Those who access or use Snagajob Properties from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">18.  <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong>  <strong><em>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Snagajob and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Us.  </em></strong></p><div>18.1  <strong><u>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</u></strong>  You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with Snagajob, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Snagajob may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). <strong> This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.  </strong></div><p dir="ltr"><strong>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH SNAGAJOB, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST SNAGJOB ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.  INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST THE SNAGAJOB IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.  IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">18.2  <strong><u>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</u></strong>  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Snagajob.com, Inc., c/o Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware, 19808 and/or e-mail <a href="mailto:legal@snagajob.com">legal@snagajob.com</a>.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>.  JAMS’s rules are also available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Snagajob will pay them for you.  In addition, Snagajob will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, Snagajob will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p><p dir="ltr">18.3  <strong><u>Authority of Arbitrator.</u></strong>  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snagajob.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).  The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  </p><p dir="ltr">18.4  <strong><u>Waiver of Jury Trial.</u></strong>  YOU AND SNAGAJOB HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Snagajob are instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 18.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  </p><p dir="ltr">18.5  <strong><u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</u></strong>  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Sections 19.6 and 19.7.</p><p dir="ltr">18.6  <strong><u>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</u></strong>  You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Snagajob, 4851 Lake Brook Drive, Glen Allen, VA 23060, Attention: Legal or e-mail <a href="http://legal@snagajob.com">legal@snagajob.com</a> within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

                        <h2>Snag Work Terms of Service</h2><p>These Snag Work Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to and govern each Snag Work Sales Order Agreement (“Agreement”) entered into by and between Snag Work LLC (“Snag Work”) and the Client indicated on the Snag Work Sales Order Agreement (“Client”).</p><div>	<br></div><h3>1.

All such payments will be billed to Client’s credit card weekly or paid by ACH transfer weekly. If any such payment is not paid when due hereunder, Client agrees to pay Snag Work interest on such overdue payment at the rate of 1 1/2% per month, or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, and to reimburse Client on demand for all costs of collection incurred by Snag Work, including, without limitation, its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><div>	<br></div><h3>2.

Neither party has the authority to make any representation, contract or commitment on behalf of the other unless otherwise expressly authorized in a written document signed by both parties.</p><p><strong>2.2</strong> Nothing in the Agreement or these Terms will prohibit Snag Work from performing similar services for entities other than Client during the term of this Agreement, so long as Snag Work’s actions do not otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement.</p><div>	<br></div><h3>3.

It is expressly agreed that Snag Work retains control over hiring and compensating Workers who perform Services pursuant to this Agreement.</p><p><strong>4.3</strong> In the event that Client hires a Worker for a full or part time employment position with Client, Client agrees to notify Snag Work immediately and pay Snag Work a cost per hire amount as specified in the Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or these Terms, if Client hires a Worker for either a full time or part time position, Snag Work will be released of all legal and financial responsibilities with respect to that Worker and its relationship with Client, effective the date the Worker is hired by the Client.</p><p><strong>4.4</strong> Client acknowledges and agrees that it will not place any Workers at a location subject to a collective bargaining agreement.</p><div>	<br></div><h3>5.

When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.</p><p dir="ltr">When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor.

In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.</p><div>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).</p><p dir="ltr">Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.</p><p dir="ltr">When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.</p><div>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information</strong></p><p>California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.

When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.</p><p dir="ltr">When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.</p><div>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).</p><p>Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.</p><p>When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.</p><p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

Your Choices and Rights</h2><p>You have certain rights with respect to your information as further described in this Section, in addition to any rights discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon your location.</p><h3>Marketing Communications.</h3><p>You may instruct us not to use your information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us using the information below. You may do so by logging into your Account and navigating towards Settings and, in commercial email messages, you can opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails.

Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:</p><ul><li>Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information.</li><li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.</li><li>Delete certain personal information we have about you.</li><li>Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.</li></ul><p>The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.</p><p>Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Service to you. We also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, phone number, or other information. You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you or to comply with a legal obligation. In some circumstances if you still ask us to delete your information, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services. If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please use the form on the <a href="https://community.snagajob.com/s/">Snagajob Knowledge Base</a> or contact us at customersupport@snagajob.com</p><p>California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.

We do share certain information as set forth in Section 3 and allow third parties to collect certain information about your activity, for example through cookies, as explained in Section 2.</p><p><em>With regard to personal information collected by Employers through Employer Direct Engagements, Seekers should direct requests to exercise applicable rights to the Employer on whose behalf we handle the data. If we receive a request from a Seeker directly in relation to information collected through an Employer Direct Engagement, we will refer that request to the appropriate Employer(s) and await each Employer’s instructions on how to handle it.</em></p><h3>California “Shine the Light” Disclosure.</h3><p>The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p><h3>Privacy Rights for Nevada Residents.</h3><p>Under Nevada law, certain Nevada residents may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such term is defined under Nevada law) for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.</p><p>We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of the sale of your covered information under Nevada law by emailing us at customersupport@snagajob.com. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.</p><div><br></div><h2>7.

                        <h1>Snagajob Privacy Policy</h1><p>The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).</p><p>Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.</p><p>When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.</p><p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. By using Snagajob Services, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our <a href="https://snagajob.pactsafe.io/legal.html#terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> that allow us to process information about you.</p><div><br></div><h2>1.

Your Choices and Rights</h2><p>You have certain rights with respect to your information as further described in this Section, in addition to any rights discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon your location.</p><h3>Marketing Communications.</h3><p>You may instruct us not to use your information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us using the information below. You may do so by logging into your Account and navigating towards Settings and, in commercial email messages, you can opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Removing your name from the email list may take a reasonable amount of time. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you.</p><h3>Account information.</h3><p>We encourage you to periodically review and update your settings and profile information to reflect your job and communication preferences. You can access these settings at any time by logging in. If you would like us to close your account, you can reach out to us and we will do so.</p><h3>Privacy Rights for California Residents.</h3><p>If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding your rights with respect to your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).</p><p>If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:</p><ul><li>Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information.</li><li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.</li><li>Delete certain personal information we have about you.</li><li>Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.</li></ul><p>The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.</p><p>Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Service to you. We also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, phone number, or other information. You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you or to comply with a legal obligation. In some circumstances if you still ask us to delete your information, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services. If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please use the form on the <a href="https://community.snagajob.com/s/">Snagajob Knowledge Base</a> or contact us at customersupport@snagajob.com</p><p>California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. We do not “sell” California residents’ personal information under the CCPA, based on our current understanding of the definition of sell.

                        <h1>Snagajob Privacy Policy</h1><p>The Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Snagajob.com, Inc. and its affiliated companies (together referred to as “Snagajob” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “Services”).</p><p>Snagajob is a provider of cloud-based software services that help connect businesses (“Employers”) looking to hire for employment positions with our network of job and shift seekers (“Seekers”). When applicable we have made distinctions in these sections between Seekers and Employers to be transparent about the different situations in which we may collect, use, or share personal information.</p><p>When we handle information about Seekers who use our Services to fill out job applications or onboarding documents/forms for specific Employers or otherwise communicate directly with Employers (“Employer Direct Engagement”), we do so on behalf of the Employers as a service provider or processor. Employers determine how to engage with Seekers through our Services and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling Seeker data in relation to Employer Direct Engagements. In those circumstances, Seekers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Employers with which they interact, and they should read those policies carefully. Snagajob is not responsible for the privacy practices of Employers. Snagajob acts as the business and not a service provider when Seekers build profiles and use related services.</p><p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. By using Snagajob Services, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our <a href="https://www.snagajob.com/terms">Terms of Use</a> that allow us to process information about you.</p><div><br></div><h2>1.

After all, scammers tend to advertise jobs openings inthe same places that legitimate employers do.</p><p>That’s why we’ve put together some tips to help you keep your information safe during your job search. Watch out for these red flags and you will be able to tell the difference between a real job and a fake:</p><ul>    <li><b>No work? No money.</b> Do not cash any checks or accept anymoney if you haven't done any work. Job scammers often say they will pay you in advance for miscellaneous items like office supplies or personal items. These checks are not real and they        will bounce.If you are unsure, you can always go to your bank and have them confirm the authenticity of the check.</li>    <li><b>Share your info wisely.</b> Applying to many legitimate jobs online requires you to provide a lot of information, like your address or Social Security number.Just remember, never give out your information throughemail or over the phone. And always        check to make sure the site you are using to apply is secure.</li>    <li><b>Stay organized.</b> Some scammers will post a job under a legitimate company name, but then contact youas a different, fake company in the hopes you won't rememberall of the jobs you've applied to. We recommend keeping a notebook or spreadsheet        that lists each position and company you send an application to and don't respond to anyone unfamiliar.</li>    <li><b>Do your research.</b> If someone reaches out to you from a company you'venever heard of, do a quick internet search to check them out to see if others have been scammed by them. Also, keep an eye out for people who do not have a company domain        name in their emailaddress, but instead use a free email service (e.g., XYZ@companyname.com vs. XYZ@gmail.com).</li>    <li><b>Be cautious with IM interviews.</b> If the employer does not want to meet you face-to-face (whether in person or over video) this is good sign that the job is a scam.In addition, they'll most likely hire you on the spot during the chat interview        and ask for your bank account information. Never give this information out through an internet chat.</li>    <li><b>Trust your gut.</b> If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Pay attentionto the pay rate you are being offered and compare it to similarjobs in your area. If they offer to pay you $30 an hour to answer phones at home because their office        is under construction, let this be a red flag.</li></ul><h2>What to do if you suspect you’ve been avictim of fraud</h2><ol>    <li><b>Place an initial fraud alert</b> - Ask credit companiesto put a fraud alert on your credit report. This will make it difficult for anyone to access your account and lasts 90 days.

Snagajob desires your services, and You are willing to provide those services. Therefore, the Parties    agree as follows:</div><ol data-section-type="4" class="ps-section ps-parent" data-id="Sy--SYro2d" data-time="1625147704918">    <li class="ps-section" data-id="BkzZHKSi2d" data-time="1625147704918"> If a wage or employment classification dispute of any kind ("Dispute") arises related to the services you provide to Snagajob or to clients of Snagajob, any terms, conditions or other matters related in any way to your relationship with Snagajob (or        its successors) or its clients to which you provide services (or their successors), or the termination of your relationship with Snagajob, both You and Snagajob (and its successors, predecessors, benefit plans, directors, officers, employees,        supervisors and agents) agree to submit the Dispute exclusively to binding arbitration, including, but not limited to, Disputes arising under statutory law (including, but not limited to any laws related to employment misclassification, wage payment,        wage statements, minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest breaks, or any other wage and hour laws), and any other local, state or federal laws, excepting only claims which may not, by law, be arbitrated (collectively, "Claims"). This agreement to        arbitrate shall apply to any and all Claims, whether asserted by You against the Company and/or any other entity, including but not limited to any Company client. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="HyX-rtSj3_" data-time="1625147704918"> Both You and the Company acknowledge that <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">both parties are relinquishing their right to a jury trial in civil court</strong>. By signing this Agreement, the parties agree that arbitration is the exclusive        remedy for all disputes related to the matters discussed in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="H1EWSFHi3O" data-time="1625147704918"> The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator licensed to practice law and experienced in employment law, and administered by <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">JAMS (or any successor)</a> pursuant to its <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/" target="_blank">Employment Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures</a> and subject to <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/employment-minimum-standards/" target="_blank">JAMS Policy on Employment Arbitration Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness</a>, except        as provided otherwise in this Agreement. Such arbitration shall take place in the county in which You primarily provide(d) services to the Company or its clients. In any arbitration, the burden of proof shall be allocated as provided by applicable        law. Either party may bring an action in court to compel arbitration under this Agreement and to enforce an arbitration award. Discovery (e.g., depositions, interrogatories, document requests, etc.) shall be available to the Company and You as        though the dispute were pending in the state or local court where You primarily provide(d) services to the Company or its clients. The arbitrator shall have the ability to rule on pre-hearing motions, as though the matter were pending in the state        court where You primarily provide(d) services to the Company or its clients, including the ability to rule on a motion for summary judgment or other dispositive motion. The arbitrator's authority shall extend to determinations regarding the scope        or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate. Any party's right to appeal or to seek modification of rulings by the arbitrator is strictly limited by state law and the Federal Arbitration Act. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="BkrbBYrind" data-time="1625147704918"> This Agreement shall not apply to claims for unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, claims under an employee benefit plan, the terms of which contain its own arbitration or claims review procedure, or claims which parties are legally prohibited        from submitting to arbitration, to the extent You are entitled to bring any such claims. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="HyUZSYro2u" data-time="1625147704918"> Nothing in this Agreement restricts You from exercising statutory rights to seek assistance through resort to federal or state enforcement agencies. However, if an agency issues a right to sue notice, binding arbitration will be the sole remedy to        the extent permitted by law. Should either party institute any legal action or administrative proceeding with respect to any claim waived by this Agreement or pursue any dispute or matter covered by this Agreement by any method other than the        arbitration described herein, the responding party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all damages, costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred as a result of such action, including any appeal. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="SkwZBYrin_" data-time="1625147704918"> Claims must be brought by either You or the Company in Your or its individual capacity, not as plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding or as a private attorney general, and the arbitrator shall not        have the power to hear the arbitration as a class, collective or representative action. To the extent permitted by law, both You and the Company waive the right to bring, maintain, participate in, or receive money from any class, collective or        representative proceeding. In the event that an arbitrator or court determines a claim must be permitted to be brought as a class or in a collective action, then this agreement to arbitrate is null and void with respect to the claim(s) permitted        to be brought as a class or collection action, except for the waiver of jury trial found in this Agreement, and such class or collective action must be brought in the appropriate court system and not in arbitration. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="ByOWrYBsnu" data-time="1625147704918"> The fees of the arbitrator and any other fees for the administration of the arbitration that would not normally be incurred if the action were brought in a court of law shall be paid by the Company. However, You shall be required to pay the amount        of those fees equal to that which You would have been required to pay to file a lawsuit in the state court of your residence. The arbitrator must provide a written decision, which is subject to limited judicial review consistent with applicable        law. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="HJY-HFrjhu" data-time="1625147704918"> Except as otherwise prohibited by law, and except as necessary to seek entry of judgment (which is required to be done under seal, unless prohibited by the court) upon an award as required by law, all arbitration proceedings pursuant to or in connection        with this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any and all filings, discovery, hearings, reports, disclosures, exhibit lists, witness lists, exhibits, transcripts, decisions, opinions and awards, and their contents) shall be kept strictly        confidential and not disclosed to third parties. In addition, all confidential or sensitive information, to the extent necessary to be disclosed to the arbitrator or exchanged between the Parties in connection with the prosecution or defense of        a claim or counter-claim or cross-claim, shall be disclosed only to the most limited extent necessary and if disclosed, shall be disclosed only after the Parties and the arbitrator have entered into an agreement further protecting such information        from disclosure to the public or third parties and taken any additional measures to guard and preserve the confidential nature of the information. Further, any disputes concerning confidentiality that cannot be resolved will be submitted to the        arbitrator prior to making any disclosures. This provision shall not exempt from discovery in any other or future action any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in, referred to, discussed in the course of, or in connection        with proceedings pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement waives or limits either Party's right to provide truthful information to or communicate in good faith with a federal, state or local regulatory or law enforcement agency, or        to prevent either Party from taking reasonable steps to investigate or obtain discovery related to any Dispute or Claim. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="rycWrYHj3u" data-time="1625147704918"> This Agreement is not and shall not be construed to create any contract of employment, express or implied, or otherwise alter the terms of your engagement with Snagajob. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="B1s-StrinO" data-time="1625147704918"> This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Either Party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the FAA to compel arbitration under this Agreement        and to confirm, correct, vacate or otherwise enforce an arbitration award. For purposes not addressed by the FAA, this Agreement shall be governed by and shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without        regard to conflict of law principles. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="Hk3bHFBihu" data-time="1625147704918"> In addition to any other consideration to which You are not otherwise entitled, including Your engagement with the Company and receipt of the compensation and other benefits paid to You by Snagajob, each Party's mutual promise to resolve disputes        by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, rather than through the courts or other bodies, is consideration for the other Party's like promise. The Parties agree that the consideration set forth in this Paragraph is wholly        adequate to support this Agreement. </li>    <li class="ps-section" data-id="r1T-Btri3O" data-time="1625147704918"> This Agreement reflects the complete agreement between You and Snagajob on the subject matter of this Agreement. Neither You nor Snagajob should rely or are relying on anything outside of this Agreement regarding its effect, enforceability, or its        meaning, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or a portion thereof, is determined to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the provision or portion thereof shall be severed        and all other provisions not determined to be unenforceable will still remain in full force and effect. The agreement to arbitrate any Claim under this Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snagajob.
