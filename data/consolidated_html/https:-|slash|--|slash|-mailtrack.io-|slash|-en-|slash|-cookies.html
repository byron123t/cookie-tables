                        <p>The websites available through the domain names <a href="http://mailtrack.io">mailtrack.io</a>,
                            maildoc.io and all subdomains or sections (<strong>"Website"</strong>) are operated by
                            Mailtrack, and use cookies and similar technologies that store and retrieve information when
                            you browse. A Cookie is a text file that stores on your computer, tablet, smartphone or any
                            other similar device, information about your browsing or use. In general, these technologies
                            can serve a wide variety of purposes, such as recognising you as a user, obtaining
                            information about your browsing habits, or personalising the way the content is displayed
                            and, depending on the information they contain and the way your computer is used, can serve
                            to recognise it. When we use the term "Cookies" we also refer to other similar technologies

                            users, the frequency and recidivism of the visits, visiting time, the browser or the
                            operator or type of terminal from which the visit takes place. In no case is data obtained
                            about the user’s name, surname, postal address or other similar data.</p>
                        <p>The specific uses we make of these technologies are described below.</p>

                                    information so that the user can access the service with certain characteristics
                                    that can differentiate his or her experience from that of other users, for example
                                    the language; <strong>analysis or measurement</strong> that allows the person

                                    be made between session cookies or persistent cookies. <strong>Session
                                        cookies</strong> are a type of cookies designed to collect and store data while
                                    the user accesses a website. <strong>Persistent cookies</strong> are a type of
                                    cookies that keeps data stored in the terminal and can be accessed and processed for
                                    a period defined by the cookie manager, which can range from a few minutes to
                                    several years.</p>
