<h3>Your Privacy Matters</h3>
<p>Welcometo PubHTML5.com ("PubHTML5", "Platform" or "Site", "Website"). We understand that the privacy of our register members, subscribers, guests and/or visitors ("Users", "you" or "your") is very important. As such, we provide this Privacy Policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal data is collected, processed, maintained and disposed by us and our 3rd party service providers ("Suppliers").
</p>
<p>The Privacy Policy describes how we treat your Personal Information when you use PubHTML5 services ("Services"). The following describes our privacy practices that are specific to PubHTML5.com.

<p>1.3 Operationally we are in compliance with, though not bound to do so, the general requirements on personal data collection and usage recommended by the United States Federal Trade Commission's guidance on "Mobile Privacy Disclosers", European General Data Protection Regulation and Califolia's online Privacy Protection Act. In particular, we carry out Privacy Compliance Assessment exercises periodically to ensure compliance in respect of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.
</p>
<p>1.4 Owing to the global nature of the Company’s business conducted over the internet, it is practically impossible for us to comply with all applicable laws / rules / regulations (and the like) as may be prescribed by individual country / region / city. We endeavor to adopt internationally recommended "Best Practices" whilst adhering to the <a href="https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/ordinance_at_a_Glance/ordinance.html">Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance</a> , laws of Hong Kong which you must agree to as the applicable law in case of dispute arising herefrom.</p>

Your request to deactivate recurring payments will be automatically processed by our payment processors and your recurring payments will stop.</p>

This type of data does not contain any personally identifiable information and is reported as an aggregate to us. We make this data available directly in the publisher’s account under statistics and in Google Analytics (for premium users who are using the Analytics integration). This type of information is important for our users who need to understand how their publications are performing in order to be able to optimize them or refine their marketing strategies.</p>
<h3>3.Why we collect ( The Purpose and Legal basis)</h3>

The GDPR governs how PubHTML5 may process your information and as well your rights in relation to it.</p>
<div>
<p> PubHTML5 will collect and use your personal data only where: </p>
<p> ● We need it in order to fulfill our contractual obligations when delivering you the Service.</p>
<p>● It is in our legitimate interest for developing and improving the Service. </p>
<p> ● You have given us consent. </p>
<p> ● It is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations. </p>
</div>
<p>Providing the personal data mentioned above is a contractual requirement. Without those info it is not possible for you to enter into a contract with our company and subsequently to start using PubHTML5. If you need any clarification regarding the provision of personal data – whether it is required by law, or by a contract, or whether it is necessary for your usage of PubHTML5, please contact our Data Protection Office.</p>
<h3>4. Transfer data to third countries including United States</h3>
<p>4.1 All the collected data is transferred to the United States for processing, we don’t back-up our data outside of the United states.</p>
<p>4.2 We undertake the transfer to the United State on the legal basis of fulfilling our contractual obligation towards you. The transfer of your personal data is necessary for us to perform our contractual obligations to you as a User under the Terms of Service and to deliver the services we have agreed with you as a User to provide.</p>
<p>4.3 We and our Suppliers have, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation, implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to keep your personal data safe.

<h3>5. Who gets access to your data and why</h3>
<p>All data collected on the Services is safe and secure. We will not make public any private information or content published privately on our site. We may, however, disclose your private personal data to a few, reliable 3rd party service providers ("Suppliers" ), solely for the purpose of operating our services: to help us provide, analyze, and improve the service, including data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the site’s functionality. These third parties have access to your information only for the purpose of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. If you are a EU resident, you need to be aware that the personal data that we collect about you may be transferred to and processed by recipients that are located outside the European Economic Area. We have taken all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law. All these 3rd party apps that have access to your data have a privacy policy that is GDPR compliant, and they will only use your data on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>
<p>We collect and share as little personal data as possible to function. Whenever you delete your account we will initiate a process that will remove your data from all these processors, if possible. In some cases it is physically impossible to distinctly identify specific users, when data is used collectively for research and statistical purposes, or it may be needed for accounting purposes.</p>
