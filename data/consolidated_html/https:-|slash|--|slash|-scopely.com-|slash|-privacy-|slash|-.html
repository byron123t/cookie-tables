Scopely will not be liable to you for more than the amount you have paid to Scopely in accordance with these Terms in the six (6) months immediately preceding the date on which you first assert a claim.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, GOVERNING LAW</b></strong></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><b>Informal Dispute Resolution</b></strong></span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a dispute arises between you and us, we prefer amicable resolution to protracted legal battles. To that end, we have created an informal dispute resolution program we believe can resolve most matters. Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you must first exhaust these steps to resolution:</span></p><br><br><ol><br> 	<li><span class="s3">CHECK THE FAQ: You can start your resolution process by reviewing our “Help/FAQ” section for the applicable game or Services. Each “FAQ” section is specific to each game, and addresses the most commonly asked questions or concerns players may have</span><span class="s1">, so please s</span><span class="s3">tart there.</span></li><br> 	<li>IN-GAME SUPPORT: If our FAQs did not resolve the issue, please complete a help ticket in-game, and be sure to clearly state your issue in the ticket. All tickets are reviewed by our <span class="s1">player care</span> <span class="s1">team</span><span class="s3">, who will work with you to resolve the issue through the inbox message system in your Account. Please bear with us; we may need to research your issue to fully resolve the ticket, and this may require us to ask further questions and engage with you over several communications. Although most issues can be resolved in this way, certain issues may require further escalation, as reasonably determined by us.</span></li><br> 	<li>ESCALATION: If <span class="s1">you’ve followed</span><span class="s3"> the</span><span class="s1"> above</span><span class="s3"> steps</span><span class="s1">, but you feel that the issue remains unresolved after our agents have stated that a matter is closed, please</span> <span class="s1">email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@scopely.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">privacy@scopely.com</span></a> and include a reference to the help ticket and specific issue you believe is unresolved</span><span class="s3">. Our </span><span class="s1">player care leads will work with you further to resolve your issue. In some cases, we may address the issue remotely. In others, we may ask to speak with you directly and will arrange a mutual time to discuss your matter. If you provide us with your phone number for this purpose, it will not be used for other purposes.</span></li><br></ol><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><b>Arbitration Agreement</b></strong></span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your issue remains unresolved after you’ve exhausted our informal dispute resolution system above, you may seek to resolve it through binding arbitration as follows:</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are a resident of the US or Canada, you and Scopely agree to resolve any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, provided you have exhausted the dispute resolution steps above and the dispute remains unresolved. This agreement will preclude you from bringing any class action against Scopely. This agreement applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory, except those described in the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate subsection. It also applies even after you stop using your Account or have deleted it. </span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">An arbitration proceeding proceeds before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so&nbsp;we both agree to give up our right to a trial before a judge or jury. Arbitration proceedings have different rules than lawsuits in court. Arbitration is less formal, and provides limited opportunity to compel the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if you or we do not like the arbitrator’s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that too, rather than a court or other agency. Unless you and Scopely otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><b>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</b></strong></span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all agree that we each still have the right to go to court to resolve disputes relating to:</span></p><br><br><ul><br> <li class="li1"><span class="s3">Your or Scopely’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents); or</span></li><br> <li class="li1">Claims that are not subject to arbitration as a matter of applicable law not preempted by federal law, and that are within the jurisdiction of the court where they’re brought.</li><br></ul><br><br><br><strong><b>No Class Actions</b></strong><br><br>We all agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis.<p></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">That means:</span></p><br><br><ul><br> <li class="li1"><span class="s3">Neither you nor Scopely can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.</span></li><br><li class="li1"><span class="s3">The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this).</span></li><br><li class="li1"><span class="s3">The arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other individuals, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.</span></li><br></ul><br><br><strong><b>The Arbitration Process, Rules, and Governing Law</b></strong><br><br>The American Arbitration Association (“<strong><b>AAA</b></strong>”) will run the arbitration between you and Scopely, in accordance with the AAA’s rules and procedures then in effect (including their Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable) (“AAA Rules”), except as modified here. If something in these Terms is different than the AAA Rules, then we will follow these Terms instead. To review the AAA Rules or to start an arbitration proceeding, you can refer to AAA’s website&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">www.adr.org</span></a><span class="s4">)</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;or you can call AAA at 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp;If either of us decide to initiate arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.</span><p></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">You get to choose whether the arbitration will take place in the county or province where you live or in Los Angeles, California. We could also hold the arbitration in some other place, but we both have to agree to that. We also agree that during the arbitration process, members of our team may still work with you to resolve your issue informally.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Either of us involved in the arbitration can ask the arbitrator to put his or her decision or award, or his or her reasons for the decision or award, in writing. Also, either of us can take the arbitrator’s decision or award to a court to confirm it or enter a judgment on it (i.e.,&nbsp;make it the same as a court judgment). Sometimes you can ask a court to change an arbitrator’s decision or award, but those circumstances are limited.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provisions in these Terms, we all agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) is the law that will be applied to determine whether the provisions in this Section 9 can be enforced and how they should be interpreted.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><strong><b>10.

Conditions No Purchase Necessary to Enter or to Win a Sweepstakes<br>Purchase may be required for other promotions that are not sweepstakes<br>Tournament play is for entertainment only and part of regular game play<br><br>GENERAL TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS. The following Promotion Terms &amp; Conditions (“Promotion Terms”) apply generally to the touchscreen entertainment promotions (“Promotions”) made available by Scopely, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Scopely”) through Scopely’s Services, including Scopely’s mobile game applications (“Apps”). Because Scopely runs a wide variety of Promotions, at times some rules may not be applicable and/or additional rules may apply as described here or in the Promotion Notice (defined below).<br><br>HOW IT WORKS. If you have downloaded a Scopely App, you may receive a notice within or outside the App (“Notice”) that you are eligible to participate in a Promotion. A Promotion could be a contest, a sweepstakes, a tournament, a gift with purchase, or a special offer. Terms and Conditions for a given Promotion are available at scopely.com/rules, or wherever otherwise designated in the Notice for the specific Promotion. If you have been directed here, then these are your terms and conditions. In some cases, Scopely may direct you to a website or other location for different or additional rules pertaining to a specific Promotion. Please read them carefully, because if you take advantage of the Promotion, you will be bound by these terms, and they may differ from other Scopely terms and conditions. If you do not agree to the applicable terms, please do not take advantage of the Promotion.  <br><br>CURRENT SCOPELY APPS: Looney Tunes™ World of Mayhem; Star Trek™ Fleet Command; Marvel Strike Force; Scrabble® GO; Dice with Ellen; WWE Champions; Wheel of Fortune®: Free Play; The Walking Dead: Road to Survival™; Yahtzee® With Buddies; Dice With Buddies™; Slots Vacation™; Disco Bees™; and Mini Golf MatchUp™.<br><br>PROMOTION DATES AND TIMES.

By participating, entrants agree to be fully and unconditionally bound by these Promotion Terms and the decisions of the Sponsor, and waive any right to claim ambiguity in any Promotion or these Promotion Terms. Winner and entrants also agree to release, discharge, indemnify and hold harmless the Sponsor(s) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents from and against any claims, damages, disability, attorneys’ fees, and costs of litigation and settlement, as well as any liability due to any injuries, damages or losses to any person (including death) or property of any kind resulting in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, from (i) redemption, acceptance, possession, ownership, misuse or use of any Prize Package or participation in the Promotion or any Promotion-related activity, or (ii) printing, distribution or production errors. Sponsor may rescind any Promotion found to contain such errors without liability at its sole discretion. Sponsor makes no warranty, representation or guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to the use of any prize, including, without limitation, quality, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose (unless Sponsor provides the prize winner with written warranties).

If for any reason an entrant’s entry is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, entrant’s sole remedy is another entry in the Promotion. Sponsor may prohibit an entrant from participating in the Promotion or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines that said entrant is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion by cheating, hacking, deception, or other unfair playing practices (including the use of automated quick entry programs) or intending to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other entrants or Sponsor’s representatives. If for any reason this Promotion is not capable of running as planned, including, but not limited to, infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, or any other causes beyond the reasonable control of Sponsor which corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Promotion, then Sponsor reserves the right at its sole discretion to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend all or any part of the Promotion and to select a potential winner from among all eligible entries received by Sponsor up until the time of such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension, as applicable. Caution: any attempt by an entrant to deliberately damage the website or undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and should such an attempt be made, Sponsor reserves the right to seek civil and/or criminal prosecution and damages (including attorneys’ fees) from any such entrant to the fullest extent of the law.<br><br>JURY TRIAL WAIVER.

FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS</strong><br><br>Any time you purchase virtual currency (including but not limited to virtual cash and other in-game premium currency), virtual in-game items, and any other premium goods or services in connection with our Services (collectively, “<strong>Virtual Items</strong>”) with real currency (i.e., real world money), Scopely grants you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use such Virtual Items. All purchases and redemptions of such Virtual Items through our Services are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by us. Scopely may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice to you. Scopely will have no liability to you or any third party in the event that Scopely exercises any such rights.<br><br>Virtual Items have no real-world value. Other than as expressly authorized in our Services, you may not sell, redeem, or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity, including but not limited to Scopely, another user, or any third party.<br><br>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you, and you agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your Account. Payments will be enabled using the payment method associated with your Account. We may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through our Services at any time. We may also from time to time provide certain users with offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or payments charged to your Account. If you choose to sign up for a subscription or VIP experience in connection with the Services, payments will be enabled in accordance with the terms displayed to you at the point of purchase, and available to you thereafter on the applicable Service(s).

Those terms will also explain how to cancel a subscription and the time period in which you should do so before you will be charged. Those terms will also be available to you after you sign up, including in-game through the Help settings.<br><br><strong>6. UPDATES TO OUR SERVICES</strong><br><br>You understand that our Service is a developing and evolving one. Scopely may require that you accept updates to our Services. While Scopely will make all reasonable efforts to inform you of any such updates, you acknowledge and agree that Scopely may update our Services, with or without informing or otherwise notifying you. You may need to update third-party software from time to time in order to receive our Services and/or play our games.<br><br><strong>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</strong><br><br>Without limiting Scopely’s liability under Section 8 below, the Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis for your use, with no warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and those arising from course of dealing or usage of trade. Scopely does not warrant that you will be able to access or use our Service at the times or locations of your choosing; that our Services will be of a certain quality or suitability, or will be uninterrupted or error-free; that defects will be corrected; or that our Services are free of viruses or other harmful components.<br><br><strong>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</strong><br><br><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><br><br>Scopely will not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or other similar damages, including but not limited to loss of revenues, lost profits, lost data or business interruption or other intangible losses (however such losses are qualified), arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or our Services, whether based on contract, tort or any other legal theory, and whether or not Scopely has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Scopely will not be liable to you for more than the amount you have paid to Scopely in accordance with these Terms in the six (6) months immediately preceding the date on which you first assert a claim. You acknowledge and agree that if you have not paid anything to Scopely during such time period, your sole remedy (and Scopely’s exclusive liability) for any dispute with Scopely is to stop using the Services and to cancel your Account. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you.<br><br>To the extent that Scopely may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of Scopely’s liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law. In particular, nothing in these Terms will affect the statutory rights of any consumer or exclude or restrict any liability for death or personal injury arising from any negligence or fraud of Scopely. This provision shall have no effect on the choice of law provision set forth below.<br><br><strong>Indemnification</strong><br><br>You agree to indemnify, save, and hold Scopely, its affiliated companies, officers, directors, contractors, employees, agents, third-party suppliers, licensors, and partners harmless from any and all claims, losses, damages, and liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of or relating to: (i) your use or misuse of our Services or goods or services obtained in connection therewith; (ii) your breach or violation of these Terms; (iii) our use of your User Content; or (iv) any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by you herein. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such matter upon becoming aware of it. You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your Account(s) or of our Services.<br><br><strong>9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION, GOVERNING LAW</strong><br><br><strong>Informal Dispute Resolution</strong><br><br>If a dispute arises between you and us, we prefer amicable resolution to protracted legal battles. To that end, we have created an informal dispute resolution program we believe can resolve most matters. Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you must first follow these steps:<br><ol><br> 	<li>CHECK THE FAQ: You can start your resolution process by reviewing our “Help/FAQ” section for the applicable game or Services. Each “FAQ” section is specific to each game, and addresses the most commonly asked questions or concerns players may have, so please start there.</li><br> 	<li>IN-GAME SUPPORT: If our FAQs did not resolve the issue, please complete a help ticket in-game, and be sure to clearly state your issue in the ticket. All tickets are reviewed by our player care team, who will work with you to resolve the issue through the inbox message system in your Account. Please bear with us; we may need to research your issue to fully resolve the ticket, and this may require us to ask further questions and engage with you over several communications. Although most issues can be resolved in this way, certain issues may require further escalation, as reasonably determined by us.</li><br> 	<li>ESCALATION: If you have followed the above steps, but you feel that the issue remains unresolved after our agents have stated that a matter is closed, please email us at support@scopely.com and include a reference to the help ticket and specific issue you believe is unresolved. Our player care leads will work with you further to resolve your issue. In some cases, we may address the issue remotely. In others, we may ask to speak with you directly and will arrange a mutual time to discuss your matter. If you provide us with your phone number for this purpose, it will not be used for other purposes.</li><br></ol><br><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong><br><br>If your issue remains unresolved after you have exhausted our informal dispute resolution system above, you may seek to resolve it through binding arbitration as follows:<br><br>If you are a resident of the US or Canada, you and Scopely agree to resolve any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, provided you have exhausted the dispute resolution steps above and the dispute remains unresolved. This agreement precludes you from bringing any class action against Scopely. This agreement applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory, except those described in the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate subsection. It also applies even after you stop using your Account or have deleted it.<br><br>An arbitration proceeding proceeds before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so we both agree to give up our right to a trial before a judge or jury. Arbitration proceedings have different rules than lawsuits in court. Arbitration is less formal, and provides limited opportunity to compel the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if you or we do not like the arbitrator’s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that too, rather than a court or other agency. Unless you and Scopely otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.<br><br><strong>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong><br><br>We all agree that we each still have the right to go to court to resolve disputes relating to:<br><ol><br> 	<li>Your or Scopely’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); or</li><br> 	<li>Claims that are not subject to arbitration as a matter of applicable law not preempted by federal law, and that are within the jurisdiction of the court where they are brought.</li><br></ol><br><strong>No Class Actions</strong><br><br>We all agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis.<br><br>That means:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Neither you nor Scopely can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.</li><br> 	<li>The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this).</li><br></ul><br>The arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other individuals, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.<br><br><strong>The Arbitration Process, Rules, and Governing Law</strong><br><br>The American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) will run the arbitration between you and Scopely, in accordance with the AAA’s rules and procedures then in effect (including their Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable) (“<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”), except as modified here. If something in these Terms is different than the AAA Rules, then we will follow these Terms instead. To review the AAA Rules or to start an arbitration proceeding, you can refer to AAA’s website (<a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org</a>) or you can call AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If either of us decide to initiate arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.<br><br>You get to choose whether the arbitration will take place in the county or province where you live or in Los Angeles, California. We could also hold the arbitration in some other place, but we both have to agree to that. We also agree that during the arbitration process, members of our team may still work with you to resolve your issue informally.<br><br>Either of us involved in the arbitration can ask the arbitrator to put his or her decision or award, or his or her reasons for the decision or award, in writing. Also, either of us can take the arbitrator’s decision or award to a court to confirm it or enter a judgment on it (i.e., make it the same as a court judgment). Sometimes you can ask a court to change an arbitrator’s decision or award, but those circumstances are limited.<br><br>Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provisions in these Terms, we all agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) will be applied to determine whether the provisions in this Section 9 can be enforced and how they should be interpreted.<br><br><strong>10. GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong><br><br><strong>Severability</strong><br>You and Scopely agree that if any portion of these Terms is found unlawful or unenforceable, in whole or in part, that provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such finding in such jurisdiction, without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will be enforced to the fullest extent of the law.<br><br><strong>Choice of Law</strong><br>If you are a US resident, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by California law, without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles, except as otherwise provided above. As described in Section 9, the Federal Arbitration Act will apply to arbitrable disputes. If you reside outside the US, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by English law, without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles.<br><br><strong>Assignment</strong><br>Scopely may assign or delegate these Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your approval. You may not assign and/or delegate any of the rights or obligations you have under the Terms unless you obtain Scopely’s prior written approval. Any such assignment and/or delegation without Scopely’s prior written approval is ineffective and in violation of these Terms.<br><br><strong>Force Majeure</strong><br>We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside of our reasonable control, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or causes such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fires, floods, pandemic, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.<br><br><strong>Claims of Copyright Infringement</strong><br>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe their rights under US copyright law have been infringed. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by us infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted by a user on one of our forums), you or your agent can send us a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.<br><br>If you believe your copyright-protected work has been posted on the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement (please consult an attorney to better understand your rights and obligations under Section 512(c) of the Copyright Act and other laws), please contact our DMCA Agent with a notice containing the following information:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Reasonably sufficient details to enable us to identify the work claimed to be infringed (e.g., title, author, any registration or tracking number, URL) or, in the case of multiple works, a representative list of such works;</li><br> 	<li>Reasonably sufficient details to enable us to identify and locate the material claimed to be infringing (e.g., a link to the page that contains the material);</li><br> 	<li>Your name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address;</li><br> 	<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material identified above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li><br> 	<li>A written statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is alleged to be infringed; and</li><br> 	<li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li><br></ul><br><br><br>If you believe material that you have posted to the Services has been improperly taken down, you may file a written counter-notice with our DMCA Agent.

Please also be advised that we enforce a policy of terminating the Accounts of repeat infringers (i.e., users who have made two or more postings for which we receive a notice of infringement).<br><br>Scopely’s DMCA Agent should be contacted only for the purposes set forth in this Section. NON-DMCA INQUIRIES DIRECTED TO SCOPELY’S DMCA AGENT WILL NOT BE ANSWERED. MISUSE OF THE DMCA PROCESS CAN SUBJECT YOU TO LIABILITY.<br><br><strong>Supplemental Terms</strong><br>Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as forums, contests, or loyalty programs (including subscriptions or VIP experiences). Supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable Service(s).

By following our Player Community Guidelines, we can all work together to ensure that everyone in our games has a great experience for years to come.\n\nOur intention with creating Player Community Guidelines is to help educate players about how to be upstanding community members, give examples of positive and negative behaviors, and help our players find the best ways to play well together.\n\nOur 5 core guidelines are: \n\n**PLAY RESPECTFULLY - RESPECT EACH OTHER**\n\nPlayers should only be challenging each other in the game, not in chat. Your intention, the context, and the impact your words and actions have on other players all matter; \n\nWays to play respectfully:\n\n- Communicate in a way that builds, rather than disrupts the community; we want to make a community that is comfortable coming back, rather than drive others away\n- Use respectful language, even when in competition\n- Focus on the impact of words on others, not just your intention behind them\n- Learn from what bothers others, not just what you would be bothered by\n\nExamples of disrespectful behavior:\n\n- Bullying or harassing another player\n- Repeatedly contacting someone who does not want to communicate\n- Using hate speech or slurs anywhere in the game\n- For example, racist, sexist, anti-LGBTQ+, religious intolerance, ableism (or targeting based on medical conditions), extreme political views, advocacy of hate organizations, and xenophobic statements\n- Using inappropriate or offensive names\n- Abusing, threatening, or encouraging for someone to hurt themselves or others\n- Sending inappropriate (e.g. violent, sexually explicit) pictures or communications in-game\n\n**PLAY FAIRLY - PLAY THE GAME AS INTENDED**\n\nScopely games are created for each player to personalize their experience through their own playstyle and how they choose to engage with the features they like.\n\nGame rules exist to ensure fair play! Abusing exploits or unapproved tools impact a player's experience while playing the game as intended.\n\nWays to play fairly:\n\n- Support healthy competition where appropriate, focusing on strategy and teamwork\n- Show good sportsmanship, whether winning or losing\n- Follow the rules of the game\n\nExamples of inappropriate behavior:\n\n- Disrupting the gameplay experience of others through abuse\n- Lashing out at others who play the game with a different style\n- Cheating or exploiting loopholes in the game, or using mechanics against their intent\n\n**PLAY WITH INTEGRITY - PROTECT YOUR AND OTHER PLAYERS’ IDENTITIES, AND SHARE ONLY WHAT YOU ARE MEANT TO**\n\nMany of our games support social activities that can drive players to share meaningful experiences.\n\nHowever, sharing information that is private or protected, such as your or other players’ personal information or account details, can hurt that experience. Sharing personal information may also be illegal in certain circumstances, and any breaches may be punishable by law.\n\nWays to play with integrity:\n\n- Keep your personal account information and unique player ID private and secure\n- Respect your own and others’ privacy\n- Share content that’s meant to be shared\n- Communicate only with other willing players within the game’s chat function or established platforms \n\nExamples of not playing with integrity:\n\n- Sharing others’ personal information, such as contact information\n- Impersonating other people or Scopely employees\n- Sharing or selling your account to others\n- Infringing on others’ intellectual property rights or personal content\n\n**PLAY OPENLY - BE WELCOMING TO NEW PLAYERS**\n\nA vibrant, global games community is one that is open to people of all backgrounds, abilities, nationalities, and interests, and all should feel welcome and included.\n\nNew players are joining all the time, and they look to their fellow players for advice, community, and examples to follow.\n\nWays to play openly:\n\n- Be welcoming\n- Be inclusive of new players from all backgrounds, such as those of a different race/ethnicity, gender, religion, sexuality, nationality, ability, and much more\n- Be helpful when talking to new players learning the game\n- Recognize that everyone comes to the game with different experiences\n\nExamples of not playing openly:\n\n- Lashing out at those who are learning\n- Bullying or belittling newer players\n- Driving players away from the game\n\n**PLAY WITH ACCOUNTABILITY - BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON OTHERS**\n\nWe encourage players to uphold these guidelines and communication practices across Scopely games and community channels, in addition to the rules in our Terms of Service and rules from particular games or channels. \n\nBehaviors against our Terms of Service may also lead to account consequences such as warnings, limiting access to chat functions, or suspending your account temporarily or permanently. \n\nIf you believe a player has violated our Terms of Services, you can reach out to customer support at https://scopely.com/customer-support/ to report it to us.\n\n\n\nScopely is proud to be home to millions of deeply engaged and passionate players worldwide who bring their diverse perspectives and experiences to our player communities. \n\nBy following our Player Community Guidelines, we can all work together to keep our communities safe, inclusive, and fun for all. \n\nThank you for playing!\n"}}],"id":"community-guidelines","subtitle":"**MODIFIED ON: MAY 16, 2022.**"}},{"name":"LegalSection","key":"dON3QCIpDxulrcRMxFelSfIRXlAdSx","props":{"menuLabel":"Promotion Terms \u0026 Conditions","title":"Promotion Terms \u0026 Conditions","subtitle":"RULES","items":[{"name":"LegalText","key":"URhx6DwBJBcUBqeV0iooaRJo4jHDXK","props":{"text":"Scopely Promotion Terms \u0026 Conditions No Purchase Necessary to Enter or to Win a Sweepstakes\nPurchase may be required for other promotions that are not sweepstakes\nTournament play is for entertainment only and part of regular game play\n\nGENERAL TERMS \u0026 CONDITIONS. The following Promotion Terms \u0026 Conditions (“Promotion Terms”) apply generally to the touchscreen entertainment promotions (“Promotions”) made available by Scopely, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Scopely”) through Scopely’s Services, including Scopely’s mobile game applications (“Apps”). Because Scopely runs a wide variety of Promotions, at times some rules may not be applicable and/or additional rules may apply as described here or in the Promotion Notice (defined below).\n\nHOW IT WORKS. If you have downloaded a Scopely App, you may receive a notice within or outside the App (“Notice”) that you are eligible to participate in a Promotion. A Promotion could be a contest, a sweepstakes, a tournament, a gift with purchase, or a special offer. Terms and Conditions for a given Promotion are available at scopely.com/rules, or wherever otherwise designated in the Notice for the specific Promotion. If you have been directed here, then these are your terms and conditions. In some cases, Scopely may direct you to a website or other location for different or additional rules pertaining to a specific Promotion. Please read them carefully, because if you take advantage of the Promotion, you will be bound by these terms, and they may differ from other Scopely terms and conditions. If you do not agree to the applicable terms, please do not take advantage of the Promotion.  \n\nCURRENT SCOPELY APPS: Looney Tunes™ World of Mayhem; Star Trek™ Fleet Command; Marvel Strike Force; Scrabble® GO; Dice with Ellen; WWE Champions; Wheel of Fortune®: Free Play; The Walking Dead: Road to Survival™; Yahtzee® With Buddies; Dice With Buddies™; Slots Vacation™; Disco Bees™; and Mini Golf MatchUp™.\n\nPROMOTION DATES AND TIMES.

These Promotions are void wherever they are prohibited. Employees of Scopely, its advertising and/or promotion agencies, and any other entities participating in the design, promotion, marketing, administration or fulfillment of any Scopely Promotion, as well as each parent corporation, subsidiary and/or affiliated company (collectively, “Promotion Entities”), and their immediate family members (defined to include spouses, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, grandparents and in-laws, regardless of where they live) and members of their households (whether or not related), are ineligible to participate in any Scopely Promotion.\n\nGAME ELIGIBILITY.

Enter by following the relevant in-App instructions.\n\nPROMOTION FORMATS (HOW TO WIN). Scopely offers Promotions in several forms:\n\nEnter to Win Sweepstakes.

A tournament giveaway is a game played for skill and fun, and fees may be assessed without providing an alternate method of entry. The winner of a tournament will receive a prize.

The Winner waives the right to assert, as a cost of winning a prize, any and all costs of verification and redemption to redeem said prize and any liability that might arise from redeeming or seeking to redeem said prize. Except where prohibited by law, the winner’s entry and acceptance of the prize constitutes permission for Sponsor and/or any Promotion Entities to use said winner’s name, and in some cases, his or her photograph, likeness, statements, biographical information, voice, city, and state address for promotional or advertising purposes, and otherwise in accordance with Scopely’s Privacy Policy (https://www.scopely.com/privacy). All entries are subject to verification prior to awarding of prizes.\n\nPROMOTION CONDITIONS: VOID WHERE PROHIBITED. Promotions are subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws. By participating, entrants agree to be fully and unconditionally bound by these Promotion Terms and the decisions of the Sponsor, and waive any right to claim ambiguity in any Promotion or these Promotion Terms. Winner and entrants also agree to release, discharge, indemnify and hold harmless the Sponsor(s) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents from and against any claims, damages, disability, attorneys’ fees, and costs of litigation and settlement, as well as any liability due to any injuries, damages or losses to any person (including death) or property of any kind resulting in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, from (i) redemption, acceptance, possession, ownership, misuse or use of any Prize Package or participation in the Promotion or any Promotion-related activity, or (ii) printing, distribution or production errors. Sponsor may rescind any Promotion found to contain such errors without liability at its sole discretion. Sponsor makes no warranty, representation or guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to the use of any prize, including, without limitation, quality, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose (unless Sponsor provides the prize winner with written warranties). Further, no responsibilities are accepted for any additional expenses, omissions, delays or acts of any government authority.\n\nRESTRICTIONS. The Prize Package consists of only those items specifically described as part of the prize in the Notice. Sponsor may at its sole and absolute discretion provide different prizes of equal or greater value. Sponsor shall not be liable to any winner or any person claiming through such winner for any claim of failure to supply the prize or any part thereof, by reason of any acts of God, any action(s), regulation(s), order(s) or request(s) by any governmental or quasi-governmental entity (whether or not the action(s), regulations(s), order(s) or request(s) prove(s) to be invalid), equipment failure, threatened or actual terrorist acts, air raid, blackout, act of public enemy, earthquake, war (declared or undeclared), fire, flood, epidemic, explosion, unusually severe weather, hurricane, embargo, labor dispute or strike (whether legal or illegal), labor or material shortage, transportation interruption of any kind, work slow-down, civil disturbance, insurrection, riot, or any other cause beyond Sponsor’s sole control.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. Sponsor is not responsible for: (1) lost, late, misdirected, undeliverable or incomplete entries due to system errors or failures, faulty transmissions, or other telecommunications malfunctions and/or entries; (2) technical failures of any kind; (3) failures of any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Promotion; (4) unauthorized human and/or mechanical intervention in any part of the entry process or the Promotion; (5) technical or human error which may occur in the administration of the Promotion or the processing of entries; or (6) any injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant’s participation in the Promotion or receipt or use of any prize. If for any reason an entrant’s entry is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, entrant’s sole remedy is another entry in the Promotion. Sponsor may prohibit an entrant from participating in the Promotion or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines that said entrant is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion by cheating, hacking, deception, or other unfair playing practices (including the use of automated quick entry programs) or intending to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other entrants or Sponsor’s representatives. If for any reason this Promotion is not capable of running as planned, including, but not limited to, infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, or any other causes beyond the reasonable control of Sponsor which corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Promotion, then Sponsor reserves the right at its sole discretion to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend all or any part of the Promotion and to select a potential winner from among all eligible entries received by Sponsor up until the time of such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension, as applicable. Caution: any attempt by an entrant to deliberately damage the website or undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and should such an attempt be made, Sponsor reserves the right to seek civil and/or criminal prosecution and damages (including attorneys’ fees) from any such entrant to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nJURY TRIAL WAIVER. Except to the extent prohibited by law, as a condition of participating in this Promotion, entrant hereby waives any right he/she may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation related to or directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to such Promotion, or any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith (including these Promotion Terms), or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE. By entering a Promotion, each entrant acknowledges that they have read and agree to Scopely’s Terms of Service (located at https://www.scopely.com/tos), and that any of the entrant’s information made available to Scopely in connection with a Promotion will be treated in accordance with Scopely’s Privacy Policy (located at https://www.scopely.com/privacy/).

FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nAny time you purchase virtual currency (including but not limited to virtual cash and other in-game premium currency), virtual in-game items, and any other premium goods or services in connection with our Services (collectively, “\u003cstrong\u003eVirtual Items\u003c/strong\u003e”) with real currency (i.e., real world money), Scopely grants you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use such Virtual Items. All purchases and redemptions of such Virtual Items through our Services are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by us. Scopely may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice to you. Scopely will have no liability to you or any third party in the event that Scopely exercises any such rights.\n\nVirtual Items have no real-world value. Other than as expressly authorized in our Services, you may not sell, redeem, or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity, including but not limited to Scopely, another user, or any third party.\n\nYou understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you, and you agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your Account. Payments will be enabled using the payment method associated with your Account. We may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through our Services at any time. We may also from time to time provide certain users with offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or payments charged to your Account. If you choose to sign up for a subscription or VIP experience in connection with the Services, payments will be enabled in accordance with the terms displayed to you at the point of purchase, and available to you thereafter on the applicable Service(s). You acknowledge and agree that, except where otherwise provided under applicable law, we are under no obligation to provide you with a refund for any items (including Virtual Items) that are in your Account, for any reason, including but not limited to termination of your Account or when closing your Account, whether such actions are voluntary or involuntary.\n\nIf you choose to sign up for a subscription or VIP experience, you will be presented with subscription-specific terms at that time, describing if and when your subscription will automatically renew, for what period of time, and at what cost, and how to tell us to cancel it. Those terms will also explain how to cancel a subscription and the time period in which you should do so before you will be charged. Those terms will also be available to you after you sign up, including in-game through the Help settings.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e6. UPDATES TO OUR SERVICES\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nYou understand that our Service is a developing and evolving one. Scopely may require that you accept updates to our Services. While Scopely will make all reasonable efforts to inform you of any such updates, you acknowledge and agree that Scopely may update our Services, with or without informing or otherwise notifying you. You may need to update third-party software from time to time in order to receive our Services and/or play our games.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWithout limiting Scopely’s liability under Section 8 below, the Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis for your use, with no warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and those arising from course of dealing or usage of trade. Scopely does not warrant that you will be able to access or use our Service at the times or locations of your choosing; that our Services will be of a certain quality or suitability, or will be uninterrupted or error-free; that defects will be corrected; or that our Services are free of viruses or other harmful components.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eLimitation of Liability\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nScopely will not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or other similar damages, including but not limited to loss of revenues, lost profits, lost data or business interruption or other intangible losses (however such losses are qualified), arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or our Services, whether based on contract, tort or any other legal theory, and whether or not Scopely has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Scopely will not be liable to you for more than the amount you have paid to Scopely in accordance with these Terms in the six (6) months immediately preceding the date on which you first assert a claim. You acknowledge and agree that if you have not paid anything to Scopely during such time period, your sole remedy (and Scopely’s exclusive liability) for any dispute with Scopely is to stop using the Services and to cancel your Account. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you.\n\nTo the extent that Scopely may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of Scopely’s liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law. In particular, nothing in these Terms will affect the statutory rights of any consumer or exclude or restrict any liability for death or personal injury arising from any negligence or fraud of Scopely. This provision shall have no effect on the choice of law provision set forth below.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eIndemnification\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nYou agree to indemnify, save, and hold Scopely, its affiliated companies, officers, directors, contractors, employees, agents, third-party suppliers, licensors, and partners harmless from any and all claims, losses, damages, and liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of or relating to: (i) your use or misuse of our Services or goods or services obtained in connection therewith; (ii) your breach or violation of these Terms; (iii) our use of your User Content; or (iv) any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by you herein. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such matter upon becoming aware of it. You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your Account(s) or of our Services.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION, GOVERNING LAW\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eInformal Dispute Resolution\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nIf a dispute arises between you and us, we prefer amicable resolution to protracted legal battles. To that end, we have created an informal dispute resolution program we believe can resolve most matters. Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you must first follow these steps:\n\u003col\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eCHECK THE FAQ: You can start your resolution process by reviewing our “Help/FAQ” section for the applicable game or Services. Each “FAQ” section is specific to each game, and addresses the most commonly asked questions or concerns players may have, so please start there.\u003c/li\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eIN-GAME SUPPORT: If our FAQs did not resolve the issue, please complete a help ticket in-game, and be sure to clearly state your issue in the ticket. All tickets are reviewed by our player care team, who will work with you to resolve the issue through the inbox message system in your Account. Please bear with us; we may need to research your issue to fully resolve the ticket, and this may require us to ask further questions and engage with you over several communications. Although most issues can be resolved in this way, certain issues may require further escalation, as reasonably determined by us.\u003c/li\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eESCALATION: If you have followed the above steps, but you feel that the issue remains unresolved after our agents have stated that a matter is closed, please email us at support@scopely.com and include a reference to the help ticket and specific issue you believe is unresolved. Our player care leads will work with you further to resolve your issue. In some cases, we may address the issue remotely. In others, we may ask to speak with you directly and will arrange a mutual time to discuss your matter. If you provide us with your phone number for this purpose, it will not be used for other purposes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eArbitration Agreement\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nIf your issue remains unresolved after you have exhausted our informal dispute resolution system above, you may seek to resolve it through binding arbitration as follows:\n\nIf you are a resident of the US or Canada, you and Scopely agree to resolve any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, provided you have exhausted the dispute resolution steps above and the dispute remains unresolved. This agreement precludes you from bringing any class action against Scopely. This agreement applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory, except those described in the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate subsection. It also applies even after you stop using your Account or have deleted it.\n\nAn arbitration proceeding proceeds before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so we both agree to give up our right to a trial before a judge or jury. Arbitration proceedings have different rules than lawsuits in court. Arbitration is less formal, and provides limited opportunity to compel the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if you or we do not like the arbitrator’s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that too, rather than a court or other agency. Unless you and Scopely otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eExceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWe all agree that we each still have the right to go to court to resolve disputes relating to:\n\u003col\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eYour or Scopely’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); or\u003c/li\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eClaims that are not subject to arbitration as a matter of applicable law not preempted by federal law, and that are within the jurisdiction of the court where they are brought.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNo Class Actions\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWe all agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis.\n\nThat means:\n\u003cul\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eNeither you nor Scopely can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.\u003c/li\u003e\n \t\u003cli\u003eThe arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nThe arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other individuals, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Arbitration Process, Rules, and Governing Law\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nThe American Arbitration Association (“\u003cstrong\u003eAAA\u003c/strong\u003e”) will run the arbitration between you and Scopely, in accordance with the AAA’s rules and procedures then in effect (including their Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable) (“\u003cstrong\u003eAAA Rules\u003c/strong\u003e”), except as modified here. If something in these Terms is different than the AAA Rules, then we will follow these Terms instead. To review the AAA Rules or to start an arbitration proceeding, you can refer to AAA’s website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.adr.org\"\u003ewww.adr.org\u003c/a\u003e) or you can call AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If either of us decide to initiate arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n\nYou get to choose whether the arbitration will take place in the county or province where you live or in Los Angeles, California. We could also hold the arbitration in some other place, but we both have to agree to that. We also agree that during the arbitration process, members of our team may still work with you to resolve your issue informally.\n\nEither of us involved in the arbitration can ask the arbitrator to put his or her decision or award, or his or her reasons for the decision or award, in writing. Also, either of us can take the arbitrator’s decision or award to a court to confirm it or enter a judgment on it (i.e., make it the same as a court judgment). Sometimes you can ask a court to change an arbitrator’s decision or award, but those circumstances are limited.\n\nNotwithstanding any choice of law or other provisions in these Terms, we all agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) will be applied to determine whether the provisions in this Section 9 can be enforced and how they should be interpreted.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e10. GENERAL PROVISIONS\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSeverability\u003c/strong\u003e\nYou and Scopely agree that if any portion of these Terms is found unlawful or unenforceable, in whole or in part, that provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such finding in such jurisdiction, without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will be enforced to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eChoice of Law\u003c/strong\u003e\nIf you are a US resident, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by California law, without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles, except as otherwise provided above. As described in Section 9, the Federal Arbitration Act will apply to arbitrable disputes. If you reside outside the US, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by English law, without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles.\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAssignment\u003c/strong\u003e\nScopely may assign or delegate these Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your approval.

Please note that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). Please do not delete our game until your request is fulfilled. If we are unable to process your request via our in-game help ticket system, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity, such as your name, email address, and information about your interactions with us or with one of our games. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.\n\nIf you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied.\n\n\u003cem\u003eAuthorized Agent\u003c/em\u003e: Californian players may use an authorized agent on their behalf to exercise a privacy right discussed above.

Alternatively, we may ask you to provide your personal information in exchange for a reward or participation in a promotion. These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time.
