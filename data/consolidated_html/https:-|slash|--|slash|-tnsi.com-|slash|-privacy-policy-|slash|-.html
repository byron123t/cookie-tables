</li>
<li><strong>Sale of Personal Data: TNS does not sell any Personal Data.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</strong><br>
We may store Personal Data at, and transfer Personal Data to, a destination outside the USA in connection with the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. This may include storage with or transfer to other TNS companies and/or third-party suppliers. By using our websites, or by providing us with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the USA and to other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as, or equivalent to, those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.

<p><strong>PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>We take precautions to protect the Personal Data we collect and store. All of our employees, as well as all of our service providers who have access to Personal Data, are obligated to protect it and keep it confidential. However, no system or electronic data transmission is completely secure. If you give us your Personal Data, you do so at your own risk. We expect that you will use appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>We may store your Personal Data during the period that we provide products and services to you or to your employer, and for up to seven years after such relationship ends. This is to ensure that we can comply with contractual obligations relating to the provision of those products and services and comply regulatory and legislative requirements. We may also retain certain information obtained from your Personal Data where such information has been aggregated, de-identified, anonymized, or pseudonymized such that it is no longer capable of identifying you.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rights of California Residents (this section applies only to California consumers)</strong></p>
<p>California consumers have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). Your rights and our obligations under CCPA are explained below.<br>
Access and Disclosure Requests: Under CCPA, California consumers have the right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that a business disclose what Personal Data it has collected, disclosed, and sold about them in the 12 months immediately preceding the request. Here are the specific types of information California consumers may request, as well as an explanation of TNS’s practices for each one:</p>
<p>1. The categories and specific pieces of Personal Data that the business collected about them in the preceding 12 months, the business purpose for such collection, and corresponding categories of sources from which the business collected the information.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the last 12 months, TNS has (or may have) collected the following Personal Data:
<ul>
<li>TNS has (or may have) collected Contact Information and/or Website Information, as described in the “COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA” section (above).</li>
<li>TNS may also collect Personal Data directly from California consumers when acting as a service provider pursuant to a contract with a business that directs TNS to collect such Personal Data.</li>
<li>You may send an access request to TNS through the following channels:
<ul>
<li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@tnsi.com">privacy@tnsi.com</a></li>
<li>Call 1-833-613-0205</li>
<li>Visit <a href="https://tnsi.com/forms/california-customer-privacy-act-ccpa/">https://tnsi.com/forms/california-customer-privacy-act-ccpa/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. The categories of Personal Information, and the categories of third parties to whom the business disclosed their Personal Information in the preceding 12 months, and the business or commercial purpose for such disclosure.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the last 12 months, TNS has disclosed no Personal Data to any third parties, except as directed by a business when TNS is acting as a service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The categories of Personal Information and the categories of third parties to whom the business sold their Personal Information in the preceding 12 months, and the commercial purpose for such sale.</p>
<ul>
<li>TNS does not sell any Personal Data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deletion Requests:</strong> Under CCPA, California consumers may request that a business delete any Personal Data that the business collected from or about them. Each such request is subject to reasonable verification of the consumer’s identity by the business. Note that there are some reasons a business will not be able to fully address a California consumer’s request, such as if the business needs to complete a transaction for the consumer, to detect and protect against fraudulent and illegal activity, to exercise<br>
the business’s rights, for the business’s internal purposes, or to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may send a deletion request to TNS through the following channels:
<ul>
<li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@tnsi.com">privacy@tnsi.com</a></li>
<li>Call 1-833-613-0205</li>
<li>Visit <a href="https://tnsi.com/forms/california-customer-privacy-act-ccpa/">https://tnsi.com/forms/california-customer-privacy-act-ccpa/</a>
<ul>
<li>You will need to provide enough information such that TNS can verify your identity. If TNS cannot reasonably verify your identity, your request may be denied.</li>
<li>The above does not apply Personal Data collected by TNS in its role as a service provider pursuant to a contract with a business that directs TNS to collect such Personal Data. Accordingly, TNS is not required under CCPA to delete, pursuant to a consumer request, Personal Data it has collected as a service provider on behalf of a business. You should direct such access requests to the business on whose behalf we collected your Personal Data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opt-out Requests:</strong> Under CCPA, California consumers may direct a business that sells Personal Data about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer’s Personal Data.</p>
<ul>
<li>TNS does not sell any Personal Data. Accordingly, TNS is not required under CCPA to respond to consumer requests to stop selling Personal Data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONTACT INFORMATION REGARDING PRIVACY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contacting Us:</strong> You may contact us at any time if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, to exercise your rights regarding your Personal Data, to file a complaint regarding how we process your Personal Data, or for any privacy-related queries. Please direct all queries and questions regarding privacy to our Data Protection Officer at the following email address: privacy@tnsi.com</li>
<li><strong>Contacting a Privacy Regulator:</strong> If you are not satisfied with our response, you can contact the relevant privacy regulator or agency in your state, or at the federal level, you can contact the Federal Trade Commission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXTERNAL WEBSITES</strong><br>
Our websites may contain links to external websites. If you use those links to leave our website and visit a website operated by an entity not within TNS, we have no control over that website, and we cannot be held responsible for the collection, use, or protection of your Personal Data on that external website. The collection, protection, use, sharing, processing, and retention practices regarding Personal Data on such external websites may be different than the practices described herein.</p>
<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed and updated. The date of the last update to this Privacy Policy appears at the top of this document. We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time without prior notice.</p>

<p>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from personal data relating to you, you may also provide the Company with personal data of third parties, notably your dependents and other family members, for purposes of HR administration and management, including the administration of benefits and to contact your next‑of‑kin in an emergency.&nbsp; Before you provide such third party personal data to the Company you must first inform these third parties of any such data which you intend to provide to the Company and of the processing to be carried out by the Company, as detailed in this European Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>8.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever the Company processes your personal data we do so on the basis of a lawful condition for processing.&nbsp; Processing of special categories of data is always justified on the basis of an additional lawful condition.</p>

<p>8.1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the above two grounds at 8.1.2.1 or 8.1.2.2 do not apply we may process your personal data where the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the Company (being those purposes described in the section above), except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data (for example reviewing your performance at work).</p>
<p>8.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will on occasion process your personal data for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data.</p>
<p>8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In exceptional circumstances where we have no legitimate interest in processing but you ask us to process data for a particular purpose we will occasionally carry out the processing on the basis of your consent (for example if you ask us to provide pay information to a bank for a mortgage application made by you). Where we rely on your consent we will make this clear at the time.</p>
<p>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special categories of data</p>
<p>8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The special categories of personal data that may be processed by the Company are set out in this European Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Where we process special categories of data it will be justified by a condition set out at&nbsp;[8.1.2] above and also by one of the following additional conditions:</p>
<p>8.2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising the rights of you or the Company in the field of employment law, social security and social protection law, to the extent permissible under applicable laws;</p>
<p>8.2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of your working capacity, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services, to the extent permitted by applicable laws;</p>
<p>8.2.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or of another person where you are physically or legally incapable of giving consent (for example in exceptional emergency situations, such as a medical emergency);</p>
<p>8.2.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The processing is necessary for purposes authorised by applicable law.</p>
<p>8.2.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or</p>
<p>8.2.1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In exceptional circumstances the processing is carried out subject to your explicit consent (as explained below).</p>
<p>8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will occasionally seek your consent to certain processing which is not otherwise justified under one of the above bases.&nbsp; If consent is required for the processing in question, it will be sought from you separately to ensure that it is freely given, informed and explicit.&nbsp; Information regarding such processing will be provided to you at the time that consent is requested, along with the impact of not providing any such consent.&nbsp; You should be aware that it is not a condition or requirement of your employment to agree to any request for consent from the Company.</p>
<p>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Processing data relating to criminal convictions and offences</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences will only be processed where authorised by applicable laws. For example:</li>
</ul>
<p>8.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a criminal record check may be carried out on recruitment or transfer or intermittently where ongoing screening is required where authorised by applicable laws; or</p>
<p>8.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an allegation of a criminal offence or conviction arising during your relationship with the Company may be processed where required or authorised by applicable law.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>8.3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where we have a legal or regulatory requirement to report an offence; or</p>
<p>8.3.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where applicable laws authorise the Company to process information about the offence (e.g. in a disciplinary process) for the purpose of making decisions regarding your relationship with the Company.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; automated decision making and profiling</strong></p>
<p>Unless written notice is provided on the contrary, no automated decision making or profiling is undertaken on your personal data.</p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em>Retention of personal data</strong></p>
<p>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company endeavours to ensure that personal data are kept as current as possible and that irrelevant or excessive data are deleted or made anonymous as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company’s general approach is to only retain personal data for as long as is required to satisfy the purpose for which it was collected by us or provided by you.&nbsp; This will usually be the period of your employment/contract with us plus the length of any applicable statutory limitation period following your departure, although some data, such as pension information, may need to be kept for longer.&nbsp; We may keep some specific types of data, for example, tax records, for different periods of time, as required by applicable law.&nbsp; However, some personal data may be retained for varying time periods in order to comply with legal and regulatory obligations and for other legitimate business reasons.</p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclosures of personal data</strong></p>
<p>11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the Company, your personal data can be accessed by or will be disclosed internally on a need‑to‑know basis to:</p>
<p>11.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local, regional and global Human Resources, including managers and team members;</p>
<p>11.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local, regional and executive management responsible for managing or making decisions in connection with your relationship with the Company or when involved in an HR process concerning your relationship with the Company (including, without limitation, staff from Compliance, Legal, Employee Relations and Information Security);</p>
<p>11.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system administrators; and</p>
<p>11.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where necessary for the performance of specific tasks or system maintenance by staff in the Company teams such as the Finance and IT Department and the Global HR information systems support team.</p>
<p>11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain basic personal data, such as your name, location, job title, contact information, employee number and any published skills and experience profile may also be accessible to other employees.&nbsp; The security measures in place within the Company to protect your data are set out below.</p>
<p>11.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your personal data will be accessed by third parties whom we work together with (including without limitation, with Hire Right (background checking) and Cornerstone (application management) and their associated companies and sub‑contractors) for providing us with services, such as hosting, supporting and maintaining the framework of our HR information systems.</p>
<p>11.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal data will also be shared with certain interconnecting systems and local payroll and benefits systems.&nbsp; Data contained in such systems may be accessible by providers of those systems, their associated companies and sub‑contractors.</p>
<p>11.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of third parties with whom your data will be shared include tax authorities, regulatory authorities, the Company’s insurers, bankers, IT administrators, lawyers, auditors, investors, consultants and other professional advisors, payroll providers, and administrators of the Company’s benefits programs.&nbsp; The Company expects such third parties to process any data disclosed to them in accordance with applicable law, including with respect to data confidentiality and security.</p>
<p>11.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where these third parties act as a “data processor” (for example a payroll provider) they carry out their tasks on our behalf and upon our instructions for the above-mentioned purposes.&nbsp; In this case your personal data will only be disclosed to these parties to the extent necessary to provide the required services.</p>
<p>11.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we may share personal data with national authorities in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.&nbsp; This is for example the case in the framework of imminent or pending legal proceedings or a statutory audit.</p>
<p><strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security of data</strong></p>
<p>12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is committed to protecting the security of the personal data you share with us.&nbsp; In support of this commitment, we have implemented appropriate technical, physical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.&nbsp; The Company uses a variety of technical and organisational methods to secure your personal data in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
<p>12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are in possession of personal data of any kind (e.g. data collected in emails, address books, Excel spreadsheets or contained in curricula vitae or elsewhere) you must ensure that the data are kept in a safe place where unauthorised access cannot occur.&nbsp; Where data is retained in hard copy, storage in a locked drawer or cabinet, accessible only to authorised individuals, is generally the most effective means of securing the data.&nbsp; Where data is kept in electronic form, appropriate password protection and appropriately secured areas should be used.</p>
<p>12.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not create, copy or export personal data relating to any other person outside of official company storage locations and systems except where necessary for a specific authorised and lawful purpose under this European Privacy Policy. In this event appropriate measures must be taken to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data during the processing.&nbsp; Once the relevant processing is complete, steps should be taken to store or return the relevant data within the official storage locations/systems with all less formally held records (e.g. local folders, hard copies, emails saved outside of formal manged folders) securely erased.</p>
<p><strong>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTERNATIONAL Transfer of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time your personal data (including special categories of personal data) will be transferred to TNS Group associated companies to process for the purposes described in this European Privacy Policy. This will be applicable for example where the relevant company or a manager from that company is responsible for conducting or approving the relevant process or the data is part of a global directory where other individuals need to have access.</p>
<p>13.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal data may also be transferred to third parties (e.g. service providers or regulators as set out above), who may have systems or suppliers located outside the European Union.</p>
<p>13.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, in some circumstances your personal data will be transferred to countries outside of the country in which you work or outside of the European Union to countries whose data protection laws may be less stringent than yours.</p>
<p>13.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company will ensure that appropriate or suitable safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and that transfer of your personal information is in compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>13.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where required by applicable data protection laws, the Company has ensured that service providers (including other Company associated companies) sign standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission or other supervisory authority with jurisdiction over the relevant Company exporter.&nbsp; You can obtain a copy of any standard contractual clauses in place which relate to transfers of your personal data by contacting <u>HR-EU@tnsi.com.</u></p>
<p>13.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TNS Group has an intra‑group data transfer agreement in place which regulates cross‑border transfers of your data within the Group.</p>
<p>13.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a right to request a copy of any data transfer agreement under which your personal data is transferred, or to otherwise have access to the safeguards used.&nbsp; Any data transfer agreement made available to you may be redacted for reasons of commercial sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your rights as a data subject</strong></p>
<p>14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right to access, correct and delete your personal data</p>
<p>14.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company aims to ensure that all personal data are correct.&nbsp; You also have a responsibility to ensure that changes in personal circumstances (for example, change of address and bank accounts) are notified to the Company so that we can ensure that your data is up‑to‑date.</p>
<p>14.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the right to request access to any of your personal data that the Company may hold, and to request correction of any inaccurate data relating to you.&nbsp; You furthermore have the right to request deletion of any irrelevant data we hold about you. &nbsp;Please send an email to privacy@tnsi.com.</p>
<p>14.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To correct/update certain information (such as your address or bank details), you will need to contact local Human Resources at <a href="mailto:HR-EU@tnsi.com">HR-EU@tnsi.com</a></p>
<p>14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data portability</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we are relying upon your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party as the legal basis for processing, and that personal data is processed by automatic means, you have the right to receive all such personal data which you have provided to the Company in a structured, commonly used and machine‑readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.</li>
</ul>
<p>14.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right to restriction of processing:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal data where:</li>
</ul>
<p>14.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you contest the accuracy of the personal data until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;</p>
<p>14.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the data;</p>
<p>14.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require them for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or</p>
<p>14.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to whether the Company has compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where personal data is subjected to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>14.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right to withdraw consent</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we have relied on your consent to process particular information and you have provided us with your consent to process data, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time. You can do this by (i)&nbsp;in some cases deleting the relevant data from the relevant HR system (although note that in this case it may remain in back‑ups and linked systems until it is deleted in accordance with our data retention policy) or (ii)&nbsp;contacting your local Human Resources contact. It will only however be rarely that we rely on your consent to process personal data for your employment or engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>14.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right to object to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we are relying upon legitimate interest to process data, then you have the right to object to that processing. If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>14.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right to complain</p>
<ul>
<li>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p>14.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For further information regarding your rights, or to exercise any of your rights, please contact your Data Protection Officer by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@tnsi.com">privacy@tnsi.com</a> or your local Human Resources at <a href="mailto:HR-EU@tnsi.com">HR-EU@tnsi.com</a></p>
