<p><b>Changes to this Policy: </b> We will post any modifications or changes to the Policy on our Site. We reserve the right to modify the Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review it frequently. The “Last Updated” legend above indicates when this Policy was last changed. </p>

                    <h3> What is Personal Information? </h3>
<p>We collect information about you in a range of forms, including Personal Information. As used in this Policy, “Personal Information” means information that directly or indirectly helps identify you (such as a name, address, telephone number, email address, or other account number) and information about your activities, such as information about your use of the Site, our products or services, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal Information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preference when such information is linked to other Personal Information that identifies you. Personal Information encompasses “personal data” as defined within the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and any successor legislation. </p>
<p>Personal Information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about your use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services, or users, from which individual identities, identifiable information or other Personal Information has been irreversibly removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected, de-identified, and then combined with information about how other users use the same service. Aggregate data helps UsableNet understand trends and users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our offerings. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information. </p>
<h4> Why do we need your Personal Information? </h4>
<p>We will only collect and/or process your Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and will adhere to this Policy. We need certain Personal Information in order to provide you with access to the Site, and may use your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy. If you created a profile/registered with us, you were asked to agree to provide certain information in order to be contacted with more information or view our content. This consent provided us with the legal basis to process your Personal Information. As we explained at the point where your consent was provided, You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your Personal Information in line with this Policy, please do not use our Site. </p>

                    <h3>What are cookies? </h3>
<p>We may collect information using “Cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. </p>
<p>We use two broad categories of Cookies: (1) first party Cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party Cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. </p>
<h4>Cookies we use</h4>
<p>Our site uses the following types of Cookies for the purposes set out below: </p>
Type of Cookie | Purpose
<p><b>Essential Cookies</b> | These Cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Site and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these Cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these Cookies to provide you with those services. </p>
<p><b>Functionality Cookies</b>| These Cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Site which you can customize. The purpose of these Cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Site. </p>
<p><b>Analytics and Performance Cookies</b> | These Cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site. </p>
<p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own Cookies. It is only used to improve how our Site works. You can find out more information about Google Analytics Cookies here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies. You can find out more about how Google protects your data here: www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB. </p>
<p><b> Targeted and advertising Cookies </b> | These Cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These Cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place Cookies to enable them to show advertisements which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites. </p>
<p>You can disable Cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising Cookies, you will still see advertisements but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove Cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some Cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed. </p>
<p><b> Social Media Cookies </b> | These Cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Site or within our products and services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this. </p>
<p><b>Disabling Cookies </b> 
</p><p>You can typically remove or reject Cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility). Many browsers are set to accept Cookies until you change your settings. </p>
