Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</li><li>Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.</li><li>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.

You have the right to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to “do not track” mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the “How to Contact Us” section below.</li><li>Many advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members, visit <a href="https://youradchoices.com/">https://youradchoices.com/</a> , and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps.

Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.</li><li>We support the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<a href="https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf">https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>) and expect that ad networks that we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</li><li>In addition, we may serve ads on third-party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our databases (“Matched List Ads”). This is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services. We are not responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. We are not responsible for such third parties’ failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may change their options without notice to us or you.</li></ul>

<h2 id="caprivacy">b. Your California Privacy Rights.</h2>



<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides California Consumers certain rights regarding their Personal Information (“PI”) as those terms are defined in the CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020.</p>



<p>We are providing you with notice of the PI we collect and our purposes for that collection for data that may be subject to the CCPA (“CCPA Notice”). This CCPA Notice does not cover information that is outside of the scope of the CCPA. This notice also does not apply to data collected from employees, applicants or contractors or to data collected from individuals acting as representatives of another business in connection with business communications or transactions.</p>



<p>We collect PI directly from you, your device or browser, your education institution, our service providers and suppliers, and our corporate affiliates. We use and share PI for the following business purposes:</p>



<ul><li>to provide requested products and services;</li><li>to advertise and offer new products and services;</li><li>to improve our products and services;</li><li>for quality assurance;</li><li>for research development;</li><li>for prevention of fraud and illegal activity; and</li><li>for marketing purposes.</li></ul>



<p>We may also collect, use and share PI for our operational purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<p>We collect the following categories of PI from Consumers which we share with our service providers, agents and licensees who perform services on our behalf, with our affiliates, and with your education institution:</p>



<ul><li>identifiers (e.g., name, phone number, email address, I.P. address);</li><li>personal records (e.g., name, phone number, email address);</li><li>customer account details / commercial information (e.g., your order history);</li><li>internet usage information (e.g., information regarding your interaction with our online services);</li><li>geolocation data (e.g., your general location based on your I.P. address); and</li><li>inferences from PI collected (e.g., your preferences, your performance).</li></ul>



<p>If you are a California Consumer and would like to register a request under your “right to know about personal information collected, disclosed or sold” (including right to obtain copies of specific pieces and/or information about categories of PI practices), “right to request deletion of personal information,” or “right to opt-out of the sale of personal information,” you can contact us at <a href="mailto:CaliforniaPrivacy@BNED.com">CaliforniaPrivacy@BNED.com</a> or toll-free at 833-720-0427. You may opt out of cookies and other tracking technologies by clicking on the CA Do Not Sell My Personal Information link at the bottom of this website. You have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment in a manner prohibited by the CCPA as a result of your exercising your rights under the CCPA.</p>



<p>To fulfill your CCPA request, we may require you to provide sufficient information to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. This verification process includes providing us at least two (2) unique data points, depending on the type of request.</p>



<p>Consumers have the right to exercise CCPA privacy rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA. Authorized agent requests must include a copy of the agency agreement between the authorized agent and the consumer. We will ask the consumer to independently confirm the agency relationship.</p>



<h2 id="the-right-to-know">The Right to Know</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Categories:&nbsp;</strong>You have the right, subject to statutory exceptions, to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:<ul><li>The categories of PI we have collected about you.</li><li>The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.</li><li>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your PI.</li><li>Thee categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.</li><li>A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure occurred.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Specific Pieces: </strong>You have the right, subject to statutory exceptions, to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.</li></ul>



<h2 id="the-right-to-deletion">The Right to Deletion</h2>



<p>You have the right, subject to statutory exceptions, to request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.</p>



<p>You may alternatively exercise more limited control of your PI by instead by canceling or modifying our email marketing communications you receive from us. You can do so by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails.</p>



<h2 id="the-right-to-opt-out-of-sale-of-personal-information">The Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information</h2>



<p>We do not “sell” PI that we collect from you, including PI of minors under the age of 16, in accordance with the definition of “sell” in the CCPA. We treat all PI that we collect from you as subject to a “do not sell” request.</p>



<p>We work with service providers and partner with advertising companies that use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about your visits to our website and third-party sites, and then use that information to deliver advertisements relevant to your interests. There is not yet a consensus as to whether third party cookies and tracking technologies associated with our websites and mobile apps constitute a “sale” of your PI as defined by the CCPA. You may opt out of interest-based advertising using ad industry opt out tools by visiting <a href="https://youradchoices.com/control" data-type="URL" data-id="https://youradchoices.com/control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">youradchoices.com/control</a> or <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">optout.networkadvertising.org</a>.

<h2 id="naprivacy">c. Your Nevada Privacy Rights.</h2>



<p>Your Nevada Privacy Rights. Under Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the sale of certain “covered information” collected by operators of websites or online services. We currently do not sell covered information, as “sale” is defined by such law, and we don’t have plans to sell this information. However, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell Personal Information covered by this Nevada law, please email your name and email address to NevadaPrivacy@bned.com to provide your name and email address. You are responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other purposes. We will maintain this information and contact you if our plans change. At that time, we will create a process for verifying your identity and providing an opportunity to verified consumers to complete their opt-out. Please become familiar with our data practices as set forth in this privacy policy. We may share your data as explained in this privacy policy, such as to enhance your experiences and our services, and those activities will be unaffected by a Nevada do not sell request. You may also have other choices regarding our data practices as set forth elsewhere in this privacy policy.</p></div><p class="styles__Paragraph-sc-lp59wn-1 glCizx"><div
