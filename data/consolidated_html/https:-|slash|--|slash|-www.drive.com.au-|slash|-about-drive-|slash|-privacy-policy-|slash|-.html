<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>



<p>We are committed to protecting and maintaining your privacy and we are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (<strong>APPs</strong>) and Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (<strong>Privacy Act</strong>). As part of our business operations we may collect your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the type of personal information we may collect and how we use, hold and disclose this personal information.</p>



<p>Please note that due to the nature of our business activities, from time to time we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption in the Privacy Act where appropriate and applicable, as discussed in more detail below. We may also rely on related bodies corporate, employee records and other exemptions in the Privacy Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Privacy Policy is in addition to the general <a href="https://login.nine.com.au/terms?client_id=drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;governing the Drive Network and should be read in conjunction with such&nbsp;<a href="http://drive.com.au/about-drive/terms-conditions/">Terms of Use</a>.</p>



<p>If your personal information is being collected via one of our websites, the specific Nine Group collecting entity will be the entity listed as the copyright owner and operator of the website at the bottom of the webpage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your personal information is being collected offline e.g. by phone or in-person, the relevant collecting entity will be made known to you as part of the collection notice given to you in connection with that activity.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-personal-information">What is Personal Information?</h3>



<p>When used in this policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include (but is not limited to) your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.</p>



<h3 id="what-kind-of-information-do-we-collect-and-how-do-we-collect-it">What Kind of Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?</h3>



<p>The type of personal information we collect will vary depending on the nature of your dealings with us. We only collect personal information that we need for our business activities, or which is volunteered to us. In general, the type of personal information we collect and hold could include (but is not limited to) your name, address (postal and email), contact details, geographic location (including your suburb or post code), gender, date of birth, activity, photograph, payment details, drivers licence (where necessary to verify your identity) and transaction details relating to your use, enquiry or purchase of products and services owned or promoted by us and any preferences you tell us about. We may collect your personal information over the internet, over the phone, when you write to us or subscribe to our services, via a live chat bot on one of our websites, through an agent or representative of us, when you attend an event or program run by us or when you participate in a survey, questionnaire, competition or other marketing campaign run by us and/or our partners.</p>



<p>In order to access some of our services and products, you will be asked to register with us by providing us with certain information about you which we refer to as your Nine Account. As part of creating your Nine Account, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password, as well as an alternate e-mail address. Currently, this may also be done using your log-in details to Facebook. By signing in on one of our websites, product or services, you may be automatically signed into other websites, products and services that use your Nine Account.</p>



<h3 id="h-information-we-collect-from-other-sources"><strong>Information we collect from other sources</strong></h3>



<p>We may access information, including personal information, about you across the Nine Group and from third-party sources and platforms (such as social networking sites, databases, Youtube, recruitment platforms such as LinkedIn and Seek, online marketing companies, agents or representatives we have engaged via our websites, Microsoft Products, third party websites such as whichcar.com.au and ad targeting companies) and supplement the information we collect with information obtained from those third party sources.</p>



<p>When you connect with us through social networking services, you will be able to see the social sharing habits of your friends and connections and participate seamlessly in our social capabilities, including commenting, live blogging, reactions, ratings, gaming mechanics and sharing content. You can connect us to your third party social networking service by downloading an application and signing into the application. By connecting with us through these third-party social networking services, you are authorising us to access and use certain information from your social network profile.</p>



<p>If you do not provide and we do not collect your personal information in the ways we have described above, we may not be able to as effectively provide you with our products and/or services that you have requested. For example, if you do not register as a member of a website, you may not be able to access features and services that are reserved for members or we may not be able to tailor the content of our websites to your preferences so your experience of our websites may not be as enjoyable or useful.</p>

<h3 id="security-and-management-of-your-information">Security and Management of Your Information</h3>



<p>We understand that the security of your personal information is important. It is our policy to ensure that all Nine Group employees understand and take reasonable steps to keep personal information secure. Once collected, we may hold your personal information in a number of different formats, including (but not limited to) software programs (located both onsite and offsite, including in the cloud), databases, filing systems, in offsite backup storage and in other similar technology. We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information (and your anonymous usage data) and keep it secure from loss, unauthorised access, modification, disclosure, interference or other misuse.</p>



<p>We also impose strict requirements of security and confidentiality on all third parties (for example, those who provide us with technology services) as to how they store, handle and deal with the personal information and anonymous usage data that we hold.</p>



<p>Personal information and anonymous usage data collected by us may be stored, disclosed and processed both in Australia and/or overseas, including but not limited to the United States, New Zealand, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. Some of our third party contractors and service providers may perform some of their services overseas and/or we may use data hosting and cloud based IP service providers who are located overseas. In all instances where this occurs, we only disclose your personal information to them and authorise them to use it in accordance with the APPs and this Privacy Policy.</p>



<h3 id="cookies-and-tracking-technologies-notice">Tracking Technologies Notice</h3>



<p>We also collect anonymous usage data about your browsing activity on the Nine Group’s network via various tracking technologies (for example, via cookies, tags, pixels). Our third party service providers may also collect anonymous usage data on the terms of their privacy policies which will be disclosed to you where relevant. This anonymous usage data may be used to identify your device on third party digital services where we have an arrangement in place to serve ads on those third party digital services. We may also collect anonymous usage data from third party digital services. One of the reasons we collect usage data is to display to you more relevant advertisements or content on the Nine Group network and also on third party digital services.</p>



<p>Tracking technologies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the tracking technology to anonymously identify your device. We use the following types of tracking technologies:</p>



<ul><li><strong><strong>Strictly necessary tracking technologies.</strong>&nbsp;</strong>These are tracking technologies that are required for the operation of our digital services. They include, for example, tracking technologies that allow you to sign in and use our services and remember you when you sign in to secure areas of our digital services.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Analytics tracking technologies.</strong>&nbsp;They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our websites. Some of the tools we use only provide us with information about trends and aggregate user behaviour. Other tools we use enable us to see how each visitor engaged with our website. For example, we will be able to see what you clicked on and how you navigated through our websites. We use this information to better understand how our visitors use our websites, so that we may make the necessary improvements to enhance our visitors’ experience in the future. We do not attempt to identify you with this information.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Functionality tracking technologies.</strong>&nbsp;These are used to recognise you when you return to our services and to allow us to personalise our content for you, for example, by remembering your preferences.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Advertising tracking technologies.</strong>&nbsp;These tracking technologies record your visit to our digital services, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our digital services and the content and advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We also use this information to determine the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose. We also permit advertisers to embed their own tracking technologies in their own advertisements. Generally, advertisers will embed tracking technologies in their own advertisements to monitor the performance of their advertising campaign.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Measurement tracking technologies.</strong>&nbsp;We also permit third party service providers to embed tracking technologies on our digital services to assist them to provide measurement and analytics services in relation to the use of our digital services.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Social media tracking technologies.</strong>&nbsp;We use these tracking technologies when you connect and share our content and information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our digital services to keep track of the way end-customers engage with and share our content. The social network will record that you have done this and this information may be linked to their targeting/advertising activities.</li></ul>



<p>We also use tracking technologies as described in&nbsp;<strong>Display of Advertisements</strong>&nbsp;below. You have the ability to accept or decline tracking technologies. If you choose to decline tracking technologies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our websites and services, and some advertising preferences may not be able to be respected. If you choose to accept tracking technologies, you also have the ability to later delete tracking technologies that you have accepted.</p>



<p>Third-party Technology Service Providers.&nbsp;We use various third-party service providers to provide us some of the technologies described in this Privacy Policy including the third party service providers listed below. These third party service providers will have access to the data we collect using their services.</p>

<p>We utilise the Nielsen//Netratings Australia auditing system on our Nine Group websites. Nielsen//Netratings Australia collects data and uses cookies and web beacons on our websites. For further information about Nielsen//Netratings Australia’s collection of data, use of cookies and web beacons or to access Nielsen//Netratings Australia’s opt-out tool, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nielsen.com/au/en/privacy-policy.html">http://www.nielsen.com/au/en/privacy-policy.html.</a></p>



<h3 id="display-of-advertisements">Display of Advertisements</h3>



<p>Many of the websites and services the Nine Group offers are supported by advertising. We may display advertisements on our websites and the sites of our advertising partners. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place cookies and/or other tracking technologies on your computer in order to recognise your computer each time we display an advertisement. The cookies and/or other tracking technologies we use for advertising have an expiry date of no more than two years. We are able to compile information over time about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements we display. We use this information and other data to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also associate this information with your visit, purchase or other activity on participating advertiser’s websites in order to display targeted advertisements or to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements for our own use and/or for the use of third parties.</p>



<p>For example, if we inferred that you are interested in bicycles, you may see advertisements for different brands or types of bicycles whereas if we infer that someone else is interested in travel, they might see advertisements for flights and accommodation packages. It is this targeting which enables us to optimise our advertising and your user experience and to provide you with more relevant information about different products and services available to you. If advertisers also embed their own cookies and/or other tracking technologies in their advertisements on our websites, any anonymous browsing data that they collect from these cookies cannot be used to target advertisements or content to users off our network. We encourage advertisers to have a privacy policy that outlines their data collection activities and usage. Please refer to such third party privacy policies for more information.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-advertising-choices"><strong>Your advertising choices</strong></h3>



<p>When we display interest based advertising, we take a number of steps designed to protect your privacy. Page views, clicks and search terms used for ad targeting are stored separately from your contact information or other data that directly identifies you. We use interest based advertising to make the ads you see on our network more relevant to you. Online advertisements on our websites are served by ad servers and exchanges. These companies may offer you a way to opt in or opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies If you would like to opt out of interest based advertising please click&nbsp;<a href="https://login.nine.com.au/advertising">here</a>. You can also manage cookies in your web browser privacy settings.</p>



<p>Please note that even if you opt out of interest based advertising, anonymous usage data may however continue to be collected by us for other purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="access-to-personal-information">Access To Personal Information</h3>



<p>Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to request access to the personal information which we hold about you. If you wish to exercise your right under the Privacy Act to seek access to the personal information that we hold about you, we ask that you contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@drive.com.au"></a><a href="mailto:privacy@nine.com.au">privacy@nine.com.au</a>.
