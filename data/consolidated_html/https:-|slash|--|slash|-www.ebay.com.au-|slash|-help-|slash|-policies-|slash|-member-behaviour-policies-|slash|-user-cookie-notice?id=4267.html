This Cookie Notice shall be read in conjunction with our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-privacy-notice?id=4260">User Privacy Notice</a>. This Cookie Notice is applicable regardless of how you access and make use of our Services including the access via mobile devices and apps.</p>

<p class="policy-highlight-warning">This Cookie Notice is effective from 23 February 2022. <a href="#section4 ">See previous version of the Cookie Notice</a></p>

<h2 id="section1">1. Information regarding the technologies we use</h2>

<p>When you use our Services, we and authorised third-party providers make use of cookies and similar technologies (which we will refer to collectively as "cookies"). We make use of two main types of cookies: those which will not be saved on your device or which will only be saved on your device for as long as your browser is active (called session cookies); and those which will be saved on your device for a longer period (called persistent cookies). We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access to our cookies.</p>

<p>The cookies used in connection with the Services have various functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>They may be (technically) necessary for the provision of our Services</li>
	<li>They help us to technically enhance our Services (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)</li>
	<li>They help us to recognise you so we can improve your user experience (e.g. by saving the font size and data entered into webforms)</li>
	<li>They enable us to show you more relevant ads</li>
</ul>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">1.1 What are cookies, web beacons and similar technologies?</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p><strong>1.1.1 Cookies</strong><br>
Cookies are small text files which are placed in the memory of your browser or device when you make use of our Services, in particular when you visit our websites or when you open a message. Cookies allow for a recognition of a specific device or browser. There are different types of cookies:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Session cookies expire at the end of your session (e.g. when closing your browser window) and only allow tracking your activities during this session</li>
	<li>Persistent cookies remain stored on your device between sessions and allow, for example, to track your settings or activities on several websites</li>
	<li>First-party cookies are set by the provider whose online service you are using (i.e. eBay)</li>
	<li>Third-party cookies are set by a provider other than the provider whose online service you are using (e.g. Adobe)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.1.2 Web beacons</strong><br>
Web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are small graphic images that are used in connection with the provision of our Services and which typically work in conjunction with cookies to track the use of an online service by its users. For example, when we send you emails, web beacons allow us to track if you opened the emails and clicked links to measure campaign performance and improve features.</p>

<p><strong>1.1.3 Software Developer Kits</strong><br>
Software Developer Kits ("SDKs") are a collection of software development tools in one installable package, which allow third-party developers to integrate with our mobile application for specific purposes (e.g. authentication). Some of the SDKs that eBay uses involve transferring data to your device.</p>

<p><strong>1.1.4 Similar technologies</strong><br>
Similar technologies include local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods, all of which store information in your browser or device to track your activity. Additionally, there are other technologies that function without local storage in your end device and instead make, for example, use of browser functions. In this context, a "fingerprint" of your system is created that serves as a unique identifier.</p>

<p>These technologies may function across all your browsers and in some cases are not fully managed by your browser, but may need to be managed directly from your installed applications or your device.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">1.2 Why do we use these technologies?</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>Some of our Services can only be offered using cookies. In general, these technologies enable us to track your user behaviour and identify you – even across devices. Please refer to our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-privacy-notice?id=4260#section4">User Privacy Notice</a> for more information about the personal data that we collect, including via cookies, and how we process this data.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.1 First-party cookies</strong></p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li><strong>1.2.1.1 Operationally necessary cookies</strong><br>

	<br>
	Because these cookies are necessary to deliver our Services to you, you cannot refuse them.</li>
	<li><strong>1.2.1.2 Analytics cookies</strong><br>

<p><strong>1.2.2 Third-party cookies</strong></p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li><strong>1.2.2.1 Advertising cookies</strong><br>
	Third-party advertising providers use cookies to deliver ads tailored to your interests. This includes using technologies to determine how relevant the advertisements are for you, which ads have already been shown to you, how often they have been shown, when and where they have been shown and if you have reacted by carrying out an activity – such as clicking on an ad.<br>
	<br>
	Users in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK can adjust their settings in our <a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/gdpr" target="_blank">Advertising and related preferences<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> page. See section 3.2.1 for more details.<br>

<h2 id="section2">2. Which service providers do we cooperate with?</h2>

<p>Some of our partners use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies to deliver content tailored to your interests, including ads, on and off our properties. This includes using technologies to determine how relevant the ads are for you, which ads have already been shown to you, how often they have been shown, when and where they have been shown and if you have reacted by carrying out an activity – such as clicking on an ad or purchasing an item. For this purpose, data may be combined with data already collected regarding your interests.</p>

<p>Service providers that we cooperate with include Facebook and Google.</p>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>We transmit information about your usage of our services, including additional personal data about you, through Facebook Pixel and by sending data directly to Facebook via our servers. "Facebook" designates Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland, for users in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, and Meta Platforms Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, for all other users.</p>

<p>These data transmissions enable us to display personalised advertisements for you on Facebook's platforms, to measure their effectiveness and to report on them. The specific processing purposes and an explanation of the related data privacy responsibilities are described in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools/update" target="_blank">Facebook Business Tools Terms<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> ("Facebook Terms").</p>

<p>The following applies only to users in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK: To the extent that we are solely responsible for the processing of your personal data in accordance with the Facebook Terms (i.e. when Facebook provides comparison, measurement and analysis services to us), Facebook exclusively acts on our behalf on the basis of an applicable processing agreement (so called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/dataprocessing" target="_blank">Data Processing Terms<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> in addition to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum" target="_blank">Facebook EU Data Transfer Addendum<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>). However, if we and Facebook assume joint control for the collection and transmission of your personal data to Facebook (i.e. specifically for the processing of data about your usage of our services for the purpose of targeting our advertisements, the improvement and the measurement of the effectiveness of our advertisements), Facebook will subsequently process the data as an independent controller and assumes exclusive responsibility.</p>

<p>We have entered into a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum" target="_blank">Joint Control agreement<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> with Facebook in order to determine the mutual responsibilities for the fulfilment of data privacy obligations with regards to the joint processing. Pursuant to this agreement, it is Facebook's responsibility to safeguard the rights of the data subjects with regards to the personal data stored by Facebook under the mutual agreement. It is our obligation to provide the above information to the data subjects. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy" target="_blank">Data Policy of Facebook<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> contains additional information about Facebook's processing of personal data, including the legal basis on which Facebook operates and the options for data subjects to exercise their rights against Facebook. For example, you may opt out of use of the Facebook pixel by logging into your Facebook account and changing your privacy or advertising as per Facebook's opt-out instructions.</p>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">2.2 Google</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>We transmit information about your usage of our services, including additional personal data about you, to Google. "Google" designates Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, for users in the EEA, Switzerland and UK, and Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, for all other users.</p>

<p>These data transmissions enable us to display personalised advertisements for you on and off our properties via the advertising products and the marketing platforms of Google (Google advertising products, such as Google Ad Manager, Google Ads), and to measure their effectiveness, to select and provide content, to provide reports about such content and to gain insights into target groups and product developments.

<p><a id="Google Analytics" name="Google Analytics"></a><strong>2.2.1 Google Analytics</strong><br>
We use Google Analytics, an analysis tool of Google to continuously improve our Services. The use includes the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyse a user's activities across multiple devices. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyse your use of our Services. The data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information on masked IP addresses below in this section).</p>

<p>On our behalf, Google processes this data to evaluate the use of our Services, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our Services. Your IP address transmitted in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.</p>

<p>The data collected via Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.</p>

<p>You can prevent the collection of data through the Google Analytics cookie by adjusting your browser settings accordingly. If you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of our Services to their full extent, however. In addition, you can prevent the collection of data related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) via the Google Analytics cookie and the processing of this data by Google by installing the following <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">browser plugin<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<p>Further information about Google Analytics can be found in the <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/" target="_blank">terms of use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> of Google.</p>

<p>We would like to point out that on our website, your IP address has been masked before sharing with Google Analytics. This means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google's servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EEA, where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person. Only after the IP address has been made anonymous is the shortened IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.2 Google Signals</strong><br>
We also use Google Signals in connection with the provision of our Services. This is an extension function of Google Analytics that enables cross-device tracking. This means that if your Internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google Account, Google can generate reports on usage patterns (especially cross-device traffic) even if you switch devices. If you have activated the setting "personalised ads" in your Google account, Google will process data for this purpose. We do not process personal data in this respect, we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.</p>

<p>You can deactivate the use of Google Signals at any time by downloading and installing the browser plugin in order to opt-out of Google Analytics (see above under <a href="#Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a>). This will prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google. In addition, you can disable the "personalised advertising" setting in your Google Account. Details can be found in <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank">Google's Help section about ads<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.3 Google reCAPTCHA: Prevention of automated access</strong><br>
We make use of Google reCAPTCHA ("reCAPTCHA") within the provision of our Services. reCAPTCHA is used to check and prevent interactions through automated access, for example through so-called bots (computer programs that perform tasks automatically and independently). reCAPTCHA is used in particular to check whether data input in connection with our Services (e.g. in a contact form) is carried out by a human or by an automated program. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the user on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis automatically begins as soon as the user connects with the online service, e.g. visits the website. For the purposes of this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various pieces of information (e.g. IP address, duration of the user's visit to the online service or the user's mouse movements). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google. The analyses by reCAPTCHA are carried out entirely in the background.</p>

<p>You can find details on <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html" target="_blank">Google's page about reCAPTCHA<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Notice<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<h2>1. Information regarding the technologies we use</h2>

<p>When you use our Services, we and authorised third-party providers make use of cookies and similar technologies. We make use of cookies and similar technologies which will not be saved on your device or which will only be saved on your device for as long as your browser is active (e.g. session cookies). Furthermore, we make use of cookies and similar technologies which will be saved on your device for a longer period (e.g. persistent cookies). Where possible, we take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access to our cookies and similar technologies. A unique identifier (ID) ensures that only we and authorised third-party providers have access to data that has been collected by means of cookies and similar technologies.</p>

<p>The cookies and similar technologies used by us have various functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>They can be (technically) necessary for the provision of our Services</li>
	<li>They help us to technically enhance our Services (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)</li>
	<li>They help us to improve your user experience (e.g. by saving the font size and data entered into webforms)</li>
	<li>They enable us to show you more relevant ads.</li>

<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">1.1 What are cookies, web beacons and similar technologies?</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p><strong>1.1.1 Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Cookies are small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) which are placed in the memory of your browser or device when you make use of our Services, in particular when you visit our website or when you open a message. Cookies allow for a recognition of a specific device or browser. There are different types of cookies:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Session cookies (also called session-based cookies) expire at the end of your session (e.g. when closing your browser window) and enable the entity using them to track your activities during this one session.</li>
	<li>Persistent cookies remain stored on your device between sessions and enable us, for example, to track your settings or activities on several websites.</li>
	<li>First-party cookies are set by the provider whose online service you are using (e.g. the operator of the website you are visiting).</li>
	<li>Third-party cookies are set by a provider other than the provider whose online service you are using (e.g. the operator of a website other than the one you are visiting).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.1.2 Web beacons</strong></p>

<p>Web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are small graphic images that are used in connection with the provision of our services and which typically work in conjunction with cookies to track the use of an online service by its users. For example, when we send you emails, web beacons allow us to track if you opened the emails and clicked links to measure campaign performance and improve features.</p>

<p><strong>1.1.3 Similar technologies</strong></p>

<p>Similar technologies are technologies which enable the entity using it to track your user behaviour. This can be done by local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods, all of which store information in your browser or device. Additionally, there are other technologies that function without local storage in your end device and instead make use of, inter alia, browser functions. In this context, a "fingerprint" of your system is created that serves as a unique identifier.</p>

<p>These technologies may function across all your browsers and in some cases are not fully managed by your browser, but may need to be managed directly from your installed applications or your device. We sometimes use the terms "cookies" and "similar technologies" interchangeably.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">1.2 Why do we use these technologies?</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>Some of our Services can only be offered using cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. In general, these technologies enable us to track your user behaviour and identify you – even across devices. You can find more information about the personal data that we collect using cookies and similar technologies in our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-privacy-notice-privacy-policy?id=4260#section4">User Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

<p>The cookies, web beacons and similar technologies used in connection with our Services serve the following functions:</p>

<p><strong>1.2.1 Technologies which are operationally necessary</strong></p>

<p>We use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies that are necessary for the operation of our Services. This includes technologies that allow you access to our sites, services, applications and tools, which are required to monitor the functioning of the site, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security, or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping carts, saved search, or similar functions.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.2 Technologies which are performance-related</strong></p>

<p>We use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Services. This happens, inter alia, to analyse how visitors use our services, how users use our messaging tools, if and how items and links are viewed, or how to improve our services.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.3 Technologies which are functionality-related</strong></p>

<p>We use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. These technologies may, inter alia, identify you when you sign in to our Services or they may store your settings or the items viewed, so that we can enhance the presentation of content within our Services and facilitate it (e.g. by means of the "stay signed in" function).</p>

<p><strong>1.2.4 Technologies which are advertising- or targeting-related</strong></p>

<p>We use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies to deliver content tailored to your interests, including advertisements, in connection with the provision of our Services or within third-party online services (retargeting, remarketing). This includes using technologies to determine how relevant the advertisements and contents are for you, which ads have already been shown to you, how often they have been shown, when and where they have been shown and if you have reacted by carrying out an activity – such as clicking on an ad or purchasing an item. For this purpose, data will be combined with data already collected regarding your interests.</p>

<p>Inter alia, we collect data regarding your device (e.g. the operating system and its version) to provide a uniform service on all your devices. You can find further information on personal data that we collect by the means of cookies and similar technologies in our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-privacy-notice-privacy-policy?id=4260#section4">User Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">1.3 Which service providers do we cooperate with?</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>In regard to the usage of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, we cooperate with authorised service providers. This includes, inter alia, ad networks and ad exchanges, which enable us to show you advertisements.</p>

<p>Authorised service providers are entitled to place web beacons and similar technologies within our online services and to place cookies on your device, as far as this is permissible according to applicable law. In this context, data for the identification of your device will be tracked, for example the IP address, the device ID or the advertising ID (IDFA – ID for Advertising or Google Advertising ID).</p>

<p>This enables the service providers to help us deliver content and more relevant advertisements, and to produce anonymous metrics and analytics, including conversion statistics. The processing of personal data by external service providers is subject to data protection and confidentiality agreements with us and applicable data protection laws. With regard to data processing by service providers, please check the privacy notices of the respective third-party providers.</p>

<p>Service providers that we cooperate with include Facebook and Google:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Facebook</strong>: We may transmit information about your usage of our services, including additional personal data about you (as described in detail in the advertisement settings), through Facebook Pixel and by sending data directly to Facebook via our servers. "Facebook" designates Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland, for users in the European Economic Area (EEA), and Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, for all other users.<br>
	<br>
	These data transmissions enable us to display personalised advertisements for you on Facebook's platforms, to measure their effectiveness and to report on them. The specific processing purposes and an explanation of the related data privacy responsibilities are described in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools/update" target="_blank">Facebook Business Tools Terms<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> ("Facebook Terms"). The following applies to users in the European Economic Area (EEA): To the extent that we are solely responsible for the processing of your personal data (including the transmission of such data to Facebook) in accordance with the Facebook Terms (i.e., when Facebook provides comparison, measurement and analysis services to us), Facebook exclusively acts on our account on the basis of an applicable processing agreement (so called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/dataprocessing" target="_blank">Data Processing Terms<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> in addition to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum" target="_blank">Facebook EU Data Transfer Addendum<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>). However, if we and Facebook assume shared responsibility for the collection and transmission of your personal data to Facebook (i.e., specifically for the processing of data about your usage of our services for the purpose of targeting our advertisements, the improvement and the measurement of the effectiveness of our advertisements), Facebook will subsequently process the data as an independently accountable party and assumes exclusive responsibility.<br>
	<br>
	We have entered into an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum" target="_blank">Agreement about Shared Responsibilities<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> with Facebook in order to determine the mutual responsibilities for the fulfillment of data privacy obligations with regards to the shared processing. Pursuant to this agreement, it is Facebook's responsibility to safeguard the rights of the affected persons with regards to the personal data stored by Facebook under the mutual agreement. It is our obligation to provide the above information to the affected persons. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy" target="_blank">Data Policy of Facebook<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> contains additional information about Facebook's processing of personal data, including the legal basis on which Facebook operates and the options for affected persons to exercise their rights against Facebook.</li>
	<li><strong>Google</strong>: We may transmit information about your usage of our services, including additional personal data about you (as described in detail in the advertisement settings), to Google. "Google" designates Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, for users in the European Economic Area (EEA), and Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, for all other users.<br>
	<br>
	These data transmissions enable us to display personalised advertisements for you in our own online listings as well as in online listings of third parties via the advertising products and the marketing platforms of Google (Google advertising products, such as Google Ad Manager, Google Ads), and to measure their effectiveness, to select and provide content, to provide reports about such content and to gain insights into target groups and product developments. You can find additional information in the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and an explanation of the data privacy obligations in the <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/" target="_blank">Google Ads Data Protection Terms: Service Information<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the exception of the use of such technologies by our service providers or other authorised third parties, we do not permit any third-party content on sites (such as item listings, communication between users, classified listings, comments, reviews, etc.) to include or utilise any cookies, web beacons, local storage or similar technologies for tracking purposes or to collect your personal data for the own purposes of such third parties. If you suspect that an offer or third-party content within our Services collects personal data or may use tracking technologies, please report this to <a href="mailto:spam@ebay.com">spam@ebay.com</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false"><a id="Google Analytics prev" name="Google Analytics prev"></a>1.4 Google Analytics</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>We use Google Analytics, an analysis tool of Google LLC and Google Ireland Ltd. ("Google") to continuously improve our Services. The use includes the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyse a user's activities across multiple devices. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyse your use of our Services. The data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information for users in the European Economic Area below in this section).</p>

<p>On our behalf, Google processes this data to evaluate the use of our Services, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our Services. Your IP address transmitted in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.</p>

<p>The data collected via Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.</p>

<p>You can prevent the collection of data through the Google Analytics cookie by adjusting your browser settings accordingly. If you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of our Services to their full extent, however.</p>

<p>In addition, you can prevent the collection of data related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) via the Google Analytics cookie and the processing of this data by Google by installing the following <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">browser plugin<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<p>Further information about Google Analytics can be found in the <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/" target="_blank">terms of use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> of Google.</p>

<p><strong>Additional information for users in the European Economic Area (EEA):</strong></p>

<p>We would like to point out that on our website Google Analytics has been extended by the code "gat._anonymizeIp();" in order to guarantee an anonymised collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). This means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google's servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EU (or in another member state of the EEA), where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person. Only after the IP address has been made anonymous is the shortened IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">1.5 Google Signals</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>We also use Google Signals in connection with the provision of our Services. This is an extension function of Google Analytics that enables cross-device tracking. This means that if your internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google account, Google can generate reports on usage patterns (especially cross-device traffic) even if you switch devices. If you have activated the setting "personalised ads" in your Google account, Google will process data for this purpose. We do not process personal data in this respect; we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.</p>

<p>You can deactivate the use of Google Signals at any time by downloading and installing the browser plugin in order to opt-out of Google Analytics (see above under <a href="#Google Analytics prev">Google Analytics</a>). This will prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google. In addition, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank">disable the "personalised advertising" setting<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> in your Google account.</p>

<p><strong>Users in the European Economic Area (EEA):</strong><br>
You can determine via the <a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/gdpr" target="_blank">advertising preferences<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> ("Google Advertising") whether you consent to the use of Google Signals. We only use Google Signals with your consent.</p>

<h3 class="title" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">1.6 Google reCAPTCHA: Prevention of automated access</h3>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>We make use of Google reCAPTCHA ("reCAPTCHA") within the provision of our Services. reCAPTCHA is used to check and prevent interactions through automated access, for example through so-called 'bots' (computer programs that perform tasks automatically and independently). reCAPTCHA is used in particular to check whether data input in connection with our Services (e.g. in a contact form) is carried out by a human or by an automated program. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the user on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis automatically begins as soon as the user connects with the online service, e.g. visits the website. For the purposes of this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various pieces of information (e.g. IP address, duration of the user's visit to the online service or the user's mouse movements). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google. The analyses by reCAPTCHA are carried out entirely in the background.</p>

Information regarding the technologies we use\u003C/h2>\n\n<p>When you use our Services, we and authorised third-party providers make use of cookies and similar technologies (which we will refer to collectively as &quot;cookies&quot;). We make use of two main types of cookies: those which will not be saved on your device or which will only be saved on your device for as long as your browser is active (called session cookies); and those which will be saved on your device for a longer period (called persistent cookies). We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access to our cookies.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>The cookies used in connection with the Services have various functions:\u003C/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>They may be (technically) necessary for the provision of our Services\u003C/li>\n\t<li>They help us to technically enhance our Services (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)\u003C/li>\n\t<li>They help us to recognise you so we can improve your user experience (e.g. by saving the font size and data entered into webforms)\u003C/li>\n\t<li>They enable us to show you more relevant ads\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">Learn more\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">1.1 What are cookies, web beacons and similar technologies?\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<p><strong>1.1.1 Cookies\u003C/strong><br />\nCookies are small text files which are placed in the memory of your browser or device when you make use of our Services, in particular when you visit our websites or when you open a message. Cookies allow for a recognition of a specific device or browser. There are different types of cookies:\u003C/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Session cookies expire at the end of your session (e.g. when closing your browser window) and only allow tracking your activities during this session\u003C/li>\n\t<li>Persistent cookies remain stored on your device between sessions and allow, for example, to track your settings or activities on several websites\u003C/li>\n\t<li>First-party cookies are set by the provider whose online service you are using (i.e. eBay)\u003C/li>\n\t<li>Third-party cookies are set by a provider other than the provider whose online service you are using (e.g. Adobe)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n<p><strong>1.1.2 Web beacons\u003C/strong><br />\nWeb beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are small graphic images that are used in connection with the provision of our Services and which typically work in conjunction with cookies to track the use of an online service by its users. For example, when we send you emails, web beacons allow us to track if you opened the emails and clicked links to measure campaign performance and improve features.\u003C/p>\n\n<p><strong>1.1.3 Software Developer Kits\u003C/strong><br />\nSoftware Developer Kits (&quot;SDKs&quot;) are a collection of software development tools in one installable package, which allow third-party developers to integrate with our mobile application for specific purposes (e.g. authentication). Some of the SDKs that eBay uses involve transferring data to your device.\u003C/p>\n\n<p><strong>1.1.4 Similar technologies\u003C/strong><br />\nSimilar technologies include local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods, all of which store information in your browser or device to track your activity. Additionally, there are other technologies that function without local storage in your end device and instead make, for example, use of browser functions. In this context, a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of your system is created that serves as a unique identifier.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>These technologies may function across all your browsers and in some cases are not fully managed by your browser, but may need to be managed directly from your installed applications or your device.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">1.2 Why do we use these technologies?\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<p>Some of our Services can only be offered using cookies.

For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the user on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis automatically begins as soon as the user connects with the online service, e.g. visits the website. For the purposes of this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various pieces of information (e.g. IP address, duration of the user&#39;s visit to the online service or the user&#39;s mouse movements). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google. The analyses by reCAPTCHA are carried out entirely in the background.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>For more details, please read <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html\" target=\"_blank\">Google&#39;s information on reCAPTCHA<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a> and <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">Google&#39;s Privacy Notice<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">1.7 Which security measures do we take to protect your data?\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<p>We protect our cookies and similar technologies to ensure that only we or authorised service providers can evaluate them.
