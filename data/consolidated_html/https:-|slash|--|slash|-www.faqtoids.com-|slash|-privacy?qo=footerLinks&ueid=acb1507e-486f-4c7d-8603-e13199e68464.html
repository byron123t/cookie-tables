<div id="3" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">3) More Details On Information Collected, Purpose of and Basis for Collection
</div>
<p><strong>Collection of Information via Cookies and other Tracking Tools.</strong></p>

<div>
    <p>
        AMG and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics, vendors who power our video player or push notification features, 
        and advertising companies we hire to promote our website and apps) use data collection and tracking tools like cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, 
        customized links, device or browser fingerprints and similar tracking technologies (together, “Tracking Tools“) to gather data when you use our Sites and apps. 
        These Tracking Tools automatically track and collect information about your activities on our SItes (See <a href="#2">Section 2 above</a> for detailed information). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies are small text files stored by your browser, to collect, store, and share data about your activities across multiple websites. Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are persistent cookies', meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by websites and advertising services to recognize you when you open your browser and browse the Internet again. Cookies can be “first party”, meaning they are served directly by us to your browser or mobile device, or “third party”, meaning they are served by either one of our vendors to provide their services to us, or by an advertising partner when we promote our services. 
    </p>
    


<p><strong>AMG uses cookies and other Tracking Tools for the purposes described below:</strong></p>
<p>
    Strictly Necessary.  These Tracking Tools are necessary for our Sites to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.<br>
    Functional.  These Tracking Tools enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.<br>
    Site Performance and Analytics.  These Tracking Tools allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and  understand how our sites are accessed in order to improve the performance of our Sites. These tools can help us test different versions of our Sites to see which features or content users prefer, and determine which of our email messages are opened. These may be first party cookies or third party cookies from our vendors who help us with analytics services. They help us to know which Site pages, content and features are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around within our Sites. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know if and how you have visited our Sites, and will not be able to monitor our performance or improve our services.
</p>
<p> 
    Targeting.  These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. 
    They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on other sites. 
    They are based on uniquely identifying your browser and device as you access our Sites. 
    If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. 
    Such information collection and use by third parties may qualify as a “sale” of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act. 
    For more information and how to opt out of any such “sale”, see Opt out of sharing for Interest Based Advertising.
</p>
<p>
    Social Media. Social media features that we implement on our Sites (like the Facebook “Like” or “Share” button) may allow the social media providers 
    to collect your IP address and the URL of the page of the Site you are on when you use the feature via Tracking Tools. 
    The sharing features may also set a social media service cookie to your browser. 
    Social Media Tracking Tools are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. 
    This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Technical information.</strong> As you interact with the Sites, we may collect additional technical
    information via additional automated means:
    </p><ol>
        <li>Information about your computer or mobile device such as type of device, mobile device ID number, screen
            resolution, web browser information and operating system or platform
        </li>
        <li>Your browser preferences and settings (time zone, language, etc.)</li>
        <li>Internet provider or mobile service provider name</li>
    </ol>
<p></p>
<p>This information is also tied to your Browser ID.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated user information.</strong> We routinely aggregate the personal information of all of our users
    into user usage statistics for our Sites. With this aggregation, your personal data is mixed with other user data
    and becomes de-identified. We are not able to identify or re-identify you or any particular user. We do not treat
    de-identified data or aggregate consumer information as personal information and we reserve the right to convert, or
    permit others to convert, your personal information into deidentified data or aggregate consumer information.
    Sharing de-identified aggregate data with third parties does not constitute a sale or transfer of personal
    information.</p>

<p><strong>Legal basis for collection.</strong> We collect and use your personal information on the grounds of the legal
    basis described below:
    </p><ol>
        <li>Provide our services: we process your personal information to provide our web search and content services.
            This is so we can comply with our contractual obligations to you. </li>
        <li>Improving our services: we analyze information about how you use our Sites to provide an improved experience
            for our users, including product testing and site analytics. It is in our legitimate business interests to
            use the information provided to us for this purpose, so we can understand any issues with our Sites and
            improve them.</li>
        <li>Compensating our partners: we process your personal information for purposes of calculating compensation to
            be paid to our third party product/service providers and distributors and to analyze usage across products,
            services and distribution partner/channel. It is in our legitimate interest to appropriately determine
            amounts to be paid to our partners and inform our product roadmap and distribution strategy.</li>
        <li>Communicating with you: we may use your personal information when we communicate with you, for example if we
            are providing information about changes to the terms and conditions or if you contact us with questions. It
            is in our legitimate interests that we are able to provide you with appropriate responses and provide you
            with notices about our Sites and services.</li>
        <li>Marketing: we may use your personal information to deliver relevant advertisements to you to promote our
            Sites, and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. It is in our legitimate interest to analyze
            the interests of our users to craft more relevant advertising messages and inform our marketing strategy. We
            may use automated decision-making to deliver tailored advertisements based on your personal information. In
            most cases, we and our marketing network partners use cookies, unique ID codes and other types of
            trackers to carry out this activity.</li>
        <li>Exercising our rights: we may use your personal information to exercise our legal rights where it is
            necessary to do so; for example, to detect, prevent and respond to fraud claims, intellectual property
            infringement claims or violations of law or our <a href="terms">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
        <li>Complying with our obligations: we may process your personal information to, for example, carry out fraud
            prevention checks or comply with other legal or regulatory requirements, where this is explicitly required
            by law, such as responding to your request for data access or deletion.</li>
        <li>Customizing your experience, including ads: when you use the Sites, we may use information about your use of
            the Sites (queries you submitted, content you viewed) to customize your experience, such as by providing
            personalized elements and showing you content based on your recent interests. We may use automated
            decision-making for these activities. Upon your affirmative consent or request, we may use your browser
            information to send you notifications about content on our site via your browser. As required by applicable
            data protection and privacy laws, we will obtain your consent for these activities or enable you to opt out
            of these activities.</li>
    </ol>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Third party links. </strong>The Sites include many links to third-party websites, services, widgets, ads, and
    other services. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share
    data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy practices.
</p>
<p><strong>Notice of Financial Incentive. </strong>This Notice of Financial Incentive applies to
    sweepstakes and other giveaways offered by AMG.</p>
    <ol>
        <p>Program Detail. By signing up for one of our newsletters, you may be eligible, where indicated, to participate in a drawing for
           a cash prize or other valuable prize. The full terms and conditions of the sweepstakes will be set forth where the opportunity to enter the
           sweepstakes is offered. We collect identifiers, such as email addresses, which you provide when you enter the sweepstakes.</p>
        <p>Value of Consumer Data. We treat the value of Consumer data collected through the program as the equivalent of relevant expenses
           related to the collection and retention of Consumers’ PI as part of the program.  The financial incentive we offer to consumers through the
           program reasonably relate to the value of the consumer’s data.</p>
        <p>Withdrawal from the Program. You have the right to withdraw from the program at any time. You may do so by unsubscribing from the newsletter in
           the manner indicated in the newsletter.</p>
    </ol>
<div id="4" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">4) Additional information about Sharing with Third Parties</div>
<p>In addition to the sharing described in the chart above, we share your information with third parties for the
    purposes described below:
    </p><ol>
        <li>Fraud prevention: we may disclose your information to third parties when we believe disclosure is necessary
            to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety,
            rights, or property of us, our users, or others.</li>
        <li>Law enforcement purposes and public safety: if requested or required by government authorities, such as law
            enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law, we may disclose any
            information we have about our users. We may disclose information collected about you in order to exercise or
            protect legal rights or defend against legal claims. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s
            personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national
            security or law enforcement requirements.</li>
        <li>
            Other IAC businesses: We are part of the IAC family of businesses (go to www.iac.com for a listing of these businesses).
            We may share information we collect, including personal information, with the IAC companies.
            Sharing information with our IAC companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you.
        </li>
        <li>Sale or merger of our business: we may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our
            affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).
        </li>
    </ol>
<p></p>

<div id="5" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">5) Your Opt Out Rights and Choices</div>
<p>You have rights and choices regarding our collection and use of your personal information, as well as the collection
    and use of some of our third party partners. A few of those choices are set forth below.</p>

<p><strong>Removing our cookie.</strong> If you remove our Browser ID cookie from your browser cache, we will no longer
    recognize your browser and activities until a new cookie is placed. Any future site activities you perform after you
    delete this cookie will not be tied to your previous activities which were associated with the removed cookie.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Removing Interest based advertising cookies.</strong> You can opt-out of third-party interest-based,
    advertising-related cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, to prevent our advertising partners to deliver targeted
    interest based ads to you. You can choose to opt-out through these (and other) resources:
    </p><ul type="circle">
        <li>Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>)</li>
        <li>Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>)</li>
        <li>Your Online Choices (<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    You will continue to see advertisements on our Sites, but they will not be tailored to you based on any past
    behavior on our Sites or other websites. You may, however, still receive customized content and/or ads based on the
    search queries you submitted or the content of the pages you are visiting.
<p></p>
<p>
    <strong>Removing LiveRamp ID Codes.</strong>  When you use our Sites or subscribe to one of our newsletters,
    we share information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system,
    with our data connectivity service providers such as <a href="https://liveramp.com/">LiveRamp</a>.
    These service providers enable us to implement cross-channel advertising and may share your information
    with third party advertising companies to enable cross-site and cross device interest-based targeted advertising.
    To opt out of this use by LiveRamp, please click <a href="https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Removing Interest-based advertising from Mobile Tracking Devices.</strong> You may opt out of tracking and
    receiving tailored advertisements on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and other similar
    entities by downloading the App Choices app at <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices">https://youradchoices.com/appchoices</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Other Privacy Tools.</strong> In addition, third party tools enable you to search for and opt-out of some of
    these devices, such as the Ghostery browser plug-in available at <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">https://www.ghostery.com/</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your
    preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. However, we do not recognize or respond to
    browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT
    means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
</p>

<p>
    </p><div id="5.1"><strong>For California users: Opt out of sharing for Interest Based Advertising (“Do Not
            Sell”).</strong></div>
    There is no industry consensus on whether enabling third parties to collect personal data via cookies for interest
    based targeting is a “sale” under California Consumer Privacy Act. We however want to give you choices regarding
    third parties using cookies or tracking devices to collect information about your internet usage while you visit our
    Sites (see the second chart in <a href="#2">Section 2</a> above for more details on these practices).
<p></p>
<p>Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as Do Not Sell signals, but we do not understand them to operate
    in that manner or to indicate a do not sell expression by you, so we currently do not recognize these as a do not
    sell request. We understand that various parties are developing do not sell signals and we may recognize certain
    such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate.</p>
<p>If you do not wish for our advertising partners and certain data connectivity service providers to collect your personal information for interest based advertising
    purposes, click the button below to “Opt Out”. As an alternative way to exercise your Opt Out right, you may contact
    us via our <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a> and we can provide further instructions on
    how to use the Opt Out button below. We manage Opt Out requests on a per browser basis, using your Browser ID
    cookie. This means that we need access to your browser when you click on the Opt Out button below in order to
    respond to your Opt Out request. We therefore cannot process any Opt Out request from a third party acting as your
    agent. </p>

        interest based targeting to you across various websites and services.
        We participate in the IAB CCPA Compliance Framework for Publishers &amp; Technology Companies (“IAB Framework”).
        When you use the above toggle to opt-out, to the extent we sell your personal information in order to deliver ads tailored to your interests,
        we will notify downstream participants of the IAB Framework that receive personal information about you to only use
        your personal information for those specific and limited purposes that are permitted under the IAB Framework. However, while we do our best to
        contractually restrict our advertising partners, including via the IAB Framework, we do not always have the means to verify or audit their
        compliance with your opt out request because we do not have access to their data processing systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our advertising partners will also be allowed to set or recognize a
        cookie on your browser only to provide services to us. This means that the personal information tied to your
        browser may still be used by our advertising partners to help us perform advertising-related functions such as
        measuring, reporting and optimizing the effectiveness of our ads, capping how many times you may see an ad,
        counting ad impressions and user actions taken after clicking on an ad, ensuring services are working correctly
        and securely, providing aggregate statistics and analytics, or reducing ad fraud.
    </p>

    <p>Please note that opting-out does not mean that you will stop seeing <strong>ads or that you will stop seeing interest-based ads</strong>,
        as some of our advertising partners may still target ads
        to you based on information they collected about you prior to you opting out. In addition, If you would like more information
        about how to opt out from interest based advertising from multiple websites and services, please visit <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://optout.aboutads.info/#/</a> and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#</a>.

            a separate opt out of selling information at <a href="https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out">https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out</a>.
    </p>
    <p>We manage your Opt Out status via your Browser ID cookie which applies to this Site only (see chart in <a href="#2">Section 2</a> above). This means that if you delete cookies from your browser or visit this Site
        from another browser or device, we will not recognize you as an Opted Out user. You will need to click on the
        Opt Out button from those other devices or browsers to effect the Opt Out for those devices or browsers.
        Similarly, if you visit another Ask Media Group Site, you will need to Opt Out via the Opt Out button located on

<div id="6" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">6) Your Access, Revision &amp; Deletion Rights</div>

<p>
    </p><div id="6.1"><strong>Right to know/right of access</strong></div>
    <p>
        If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, in California, or in certain other states, you have
        specific rights to know and have access to the personal information that has been collected and stored by the web
        properties that you visit (and in the EEA, right to correct such information). Your rights can only be exercised if
        such web properties can adequately verify that you are the same person as the user whose data is being requested. 
    </p>
    
    For Sites that do not require you to provide us with your email address, 
    we do not collect sufficient data to authenticate any particular user. As indicated in <a href="#2">Section 2</a> above, we only recognize a unique browser based on the Browser ID we assign to that
    browser for a particular Site. A Browser ID could therefore correspond to multiple individuals. In the same way, one
    user could have multiple unique browser IDs if they visit multiple Sites or visit the same Sites with multiple
    devices or browsers. Since the personal information we collect related to a Browser ID is not sufficient to verify
    that the corresponding browser belongs to the person making the request, we are not able to provide any information
    in response to any request to know or access specific personal information about a user. This is to prevent anyone from
    using your browser to obtain your search or browsing history. We want to make sure your search and browsing history
    does not fall into the wrong hands.
<p></p>

<p>However, upon your request, and provided you are able to provide to us your Browser ID, then we may provide you with
    the following information collected within the last 12 months:
    </p><ul type="circle">
        <li>Which categories of personal information we have collected about you (based on your Browser ID or other
            information you have provided to us), and how we collected that information, as well as the business or
            commercial purposes for our collecting such personal information.
        </li>
        <li>A list of the categories of personal information shared with third parties for a business purpose and the
            categories of third parties to whom we have shared your personal information.
        </li>
        <li>A list of categories of personal information that may have been collected by third parties when you visited
            our Site, and the categories of third parties who may have collected such information.
        </li>

    Information relating to your Browser ID is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to provide
    information for the full 12 months preceding your request.
<p></p>
<p>If you have provided to us your email address to subscribe to one of our newsletters,
    your email is not automatically tied to your Browser ID, and therefore you have to request us to delete your email separately.
    
    </p><p>
        If you have created an account with one of our Sites, and we are able to authenticate your account via your email address, then we are able to provide to you a log of all of your activities on the Site that is tied to your account for that Site. 
    </p>        
    If you have submitted a <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a> request, or have submitted a job application with
    us, your contact information will not be tied to your Browser ID and we will not be able to verify that any Browser
    ID information corresponds to any additional information you provide to us. See below for email deletion requests.<p></p>

<p>
    </p><div id="6.2"><strong>Right to delete</strong></div>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, California, or in certain other states, you have
    specific rights to request us to delete any personal information we have stored about you. In the EEA, you also have
    the right to withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to us to store or use your personal information.
    As indicated above, since all personal information we have is tied to your Browser ID, we are only able to delete
    your personal information from our databases if you can provide to us that Browser ID. You can also request deletion
    of certain other information that is not tied to your Browser ID as further described below.

    To request us to access personal information categories or delete personal information we have collected with
    respect to your Browser ID, please follow these steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Click on the Browser ID button below to get your Browser ID and copy your Browser ID to a safe place so you
            can later send it to us. Remember that this Browser ID is unique to this website. If you visit a
            different Site with the same browser, you will be identified as a different user with a different
            Browser ID.
        </li>
        <div class="userIdBlock">
            <button id="userIdBtn">Browser ID</button>

        </div>
        <li>
            Contact us via our <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a>, click the “Contact Us”
            button, then fill out the form. Select “Request access to or deletion of your personal data” in the
            drop-down for the Subject field.
        </li>
        <li>Provide your Browser ID number</li>
        <li>Provide a written and signed statement confirming that:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>You are a resident of California, or a country in the EEA (please indicate which country) or another
                    state where the laws provide you similar rights (please indicate which state)</li>
                <li>You are the rightful owner of the browser that corresponds to the Browser ID you are providing; and
                </li>
                <li>you are the sole user of that browser and no other individual has used the browser</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Clarify whether you are requesting us to (a) delete all of the personal information tied to your Browser ID;
            or (b) send to you information on the categories of personal data we have collected and shared that are tied
            to your Browser ID.</li>
        <li>To assist us in processing your request in a timely manner, please make your request in English if you are
            able to do so.</li>
    </ol>
<p></p>

<p>Unless you have created an account with us, we manage requests to delete or access personal information on a per Browser ID basis, which is the only way we have
    of recognizing or authenticating a user. Even if you have created an account with us and submitted your email address,
    we may not automatically tie your email address to your browser ID. This means that we need access to your browser when you click on the
    Browser ID button above and will process your request based on that Browser ID. We therefore cannot process any
    request from a third party acting as your agent. For email deletion requests, see below.
</p>

<p>All requests for access or deletion will be reviewed by our legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in
    compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests. We try to
    respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request
    is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you
    updated. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge
    a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome.
    If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we
    made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will
    charge you for responding to your request.
</p>

<p>
    </p><div><strong>Unsubscribe and deletion of email information </strong></div>
    To stop receiving email communications from us, you can opt out by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the email you
    receive, or by contacting us via our <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a> and requesting
    us to no longer receive emails from us. Note that regardless of your email preference settings, we may send you
    transactional and administrative messages regarding our Sites and services.
<p></p>

<p>If you have provided your email address to us by subscribing to one of our Sites’ newsletters or other email communications, you may
    request us to remove your email from our database by contacting us via our <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a>. Note that your email is not automatically tied to your Browser ID
    and so deleting your email will not automatically delete from our systems all personal information we have relating
    to your activities on our Sites. See <a href="#2">Section 2</a> for more details on Browser ID related personal
    information.
</p>

<p>
    </p><div><strong>Terminating your account and deleting your account information</strong></div>
    If you have created an account with one of our Sites, you may at any time terminate your account by contacting us via our 
    HelpDesk and asking us to terminate your account. Please note that this process can take up to 30 days to complete. 
    Even after your account is terminated, we may retain your data for as long as we have a legitimate purpose to do so (and in accordance with applicable law), 
    including to assist with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 
    We may retain and disclose such data pursuant to this Privacy Policy after your account has been terminated. 
    If you would like us to also delete all information we have that is tied to your account, let us know in your request.
<p></p>

<p>
    </p><div><strong>Deletion of information you submit via our HelpDesk</strong></div>
    You may request us to delete all the information you submitted to us via our <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a> by contacting us via our HelpDesk. However, we
    reserve the right to retain any information you provided via our HelpDesk in order to defend legal claims, retain a
    record of our compliance with laws, including privacy and data protection laws, and other statutory data retention
    requirements. Note that except when you provide your Browser ID via a HelpDesk request, your HelpDesk request
    information is not tied to your Browser ID. Deleting your <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a> request information will not automatically delete
    from our systems all personal information we have relating to your activities on our Sites and you must make these
    requests separately. See <a href="#2">Section 2</a> for more details on Browser ID related personal information.
<p></p>

<p>
    </p><div><strong>Deletion of information you submit in response to a job posting</strong></div>
    You may request us to delete all the information you submitted to us in response to a job posting by contacting us
    via our <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a>. However, we reserve the right to retain any
    information you provided to us to apply for a position at Ask Media Group in order to defend legal claims, retain a
    record of our compliance with laws, and other statutory data retention requirements. Note that your job application
    information is not tied to your Browser ID and so deleting your job application information will not automatically
    delete from our systems all personal information we have relating to your activities on our Sites. See <a href="#2">Section 2</a> for more details on Browser ID-related personal information.
<p></p>

<div id="7" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">7) Data Hosted in the United States</div>
<p>
    Ask Media Group is headquartered in California, and in order to access our Sites,
    your browser interacts directly with our Site servers in the United States.
    By visiting or using our Sites, your data is automatically collected, processed and stored on servers located in the United States.
    If you are located in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Switzerland, or the European Economic Area (“EEA”),
    this means your data is stored in a country the laws of which may offer less personal data protection than your country.
    We however comply with requirements set forth in the EU General Data Protection Regulation when we process your data,
    and you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data supervisory authority of your country if you feel that we
    have unlawfully processed your data.
</p>

<p>Your personal data is also processed in the United States by some of the third parties with whom we share your data, as detailed in the chart in the
 <a href="#2">Information We Collect, How We Use It, and How and Why We Share It</a>
    Section above and in the <a href="#4">Additional information about Sharing with Third Parties</a>
    section above. We have entered into data processing agreements with service providers who process your data that restrict and regulate their processing of your data on our behalf.
</p>

<p>
    If you are in the UK, Switzerland, or the EEA and you do not consent to your data being processed by us or by our service providers in the United States,
    please follow the steps outlined in the <a href="#6.2">Right to delete</a>
    section above and contact us via our <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a>,
    and please stop accessing our Sites.
</p>

<div id="8" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">8) Non Discrimination, Complaints and Disputes</div>
<p>
    All content and services offered on the Sites are free of charge and Ask Media Group will not discriminate against
    any user who has exercised their rights as set forth in this privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
    We commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  Inquiries,
    concerns or complaints may be submitted to us <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern about your privacy.
    If, however, you believe that we have not satisfactorily addressed your complaint or concern, you may have the right
    to make a complaint to the data protection authority of your state of residence. AMG is further subject to the investigatory
    and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States.
</p>

<div id="9" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">9) Data Retention and Security</div>
<p>We have designed our Browser ID system so that we can manage our Sites while collecting as little information about
    our users as possible. We generally retain the information tied to your Browser ID for a period of fourteen (14) months, unless necessary
    for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements for example to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
</p>

<p>If you subscribe to one of our Sites’ email communications and provide us your email address, we will keep your email
    address for as long as you open our email communications and six months after your email address becomes
    unresponsive to our emails or when you unsubscribe.</p>

<p>
    If you have created an account with one of our Sites, we retain all information associated with your account for 60 days after your account is terminated, 
    unless you instruct us otherwise, after which your account activity data remains but is anonymized and no longer tied to your email address, 
    account ID, or any other information that may identify you.
</p>

<p>We retain information in our <a href="https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">HelpDesk</a> system for up to three
    years to respond to discovery requests in the event of litigation or have the ability to defend legal claims. </p>

<p>We retain information you provide to apply for jobs at Ask Media group for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate
    business need to do so (for example, to contact you if we have a job opening that fits your qualification, or to
    comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements) after which our service provider Greenhouse will
    either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
    stored in backup archives), then they will securely store your information and isolate it from any further
    processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p>We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to
    protect your information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or
    damage. We also limit access to information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide
    products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100%
    effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.
</p>

<div id="10" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">10) Updates to this Privacy Policy and Contact Information</div>
<p>We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, applicable laws, business practices, and
    our user’s needs, and may make changes accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates. If we make any
    material changes, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on this page, along with its effective date, and notify
    you by means of a notice on the Sites. Except in connection with updates that materially change the ways in which we
    process your information, your continued use of the Services after this Privacy Policy has been updated means that
    you agree to be bound by such updates. We will provide notice in advance of the effective date with regard to any
    updates that materially change the ways in which we process your personal information.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the manner in which your information is processed
    (or if you are an EEA resident, how your data is transferred outside of the EEA), or if you would like to submit a
    request to us, please contact our Data Protection Officer <a href=" https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us">here</a> or via mail at:
