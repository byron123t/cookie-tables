<p>If you reside in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, our use of your personal information is governed by the GDPR
or applicable EEA, UK, or Swiss national laws. These grant you the following rights:</p>



<ul><li><strong><em>Right of access </em></strong>(Art. 15 GDPR): You have the right to ask us for confirmation on
          whether we are processing your personal information, and access to the personal information and related
          information on that processing (e.g., the purposes of the processing, or the categories of personal
          information involved). You also have the right to access your personal information, by requesting a copy of
          the personal information about you.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to rectification</em></strong> (Art. 16 GDPR): You have the right to have your personal
          information corrected, as permitted by law.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to erasure</em></strong> (Art. 17 GDPR): Subject to the requirements of Art. 17 GDPR, you
          have the right to ask us to delete your personal information, as permitted by law. This right may be exercised
          among other things: (i) when your personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it
          was collected or otherwise processed; (ii) when you withdraw consent on which processing is based on your
          consent and where there is no other legal ground for processing; (iii) when you object to processing that is
          necessary for our legitimate interests (pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR) and there are no overriding legitimate
          grounds for the processing, or when you object to your personal information being used for direct marketing
          purposes (pursuant to Art. 21(2) GDPR); or (iv) when your personal information has been unlawfully processed.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to restriction of processing</em></strong> (Art. 18 GDPR): Subject to the requirements of
          Art. 18 GDPR, you have the right to request the restriction of our processing under limited circumstances,
          including: when the accuracy of your personal information is contested; when the processing is unlawful and
          you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of the use of your personal
          information instead; and when you have objected to processing that is necessary for our legitimate interests
          (pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR) pending the verification whether our legitimate interest overrides your grounds.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to data portability</em></strong> (Art. 20 GDPR): Subject to the requirements of Art. 20
          GDPR, you have the right to receive the personal information that you have provided to us, in a structured,
          commonly used, and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that information to another
          controller, including to have it transmitted directly, where technically feasible.
        </li><li><strong><em>Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR): </em></strong>You have the right to object to our processing of
          your personal information, as permitted by law. This right is limited to processing that is necessary for the
          performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
          the controller or processing which is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(e) or
          (f) GDPR), and includes profiling based on those provisions, and processing for direct marketing purposes.
        </li><li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> (Art. 7(3) GDPR): where we process your personal information on
          the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, such withdrawal
          does not affect the lawfulness of the processing that occurred prior to such withdrawal.

<h2 class="section-anchor" data-rank="2" id="storage-of-your-personal-information">STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>



<p>We will keep your data only for as long as it is necessary for the specific purpose or purposes for which we
have collected or used them in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="account-deletion">Account deletion</h3>



<p>If you want to <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">permanently delete your account</a> or following your explicit request for deletion of any of your personal information, we will delete your account and/or help you to delete your personal information as requested. Due to the nature of the game and the way that users interact, you will need to take all steps necessary to facilitate the deletion, including adopting or removing any geocaches you own, <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleting your logs</a>, and disabling your account. We will then complete the deletion process as soon as possible. The way our systems are structured, in some cases, it may take up to 30 days for records to be deleted or overwritten. In some circumstances (set out below) we may keep your personal information for longer.</p>



<p>Because of the nature of the game, which requires a cellular data plan or GPS device and the ability to travel to geocache locations, our services are not directed toward anyone under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 16 has an account not created and managed by you, then you may alert us via <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=request" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email</a> or otherwise <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact us</a> and request that we delete that child’s personal information.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="when-you-stop-playing">When you stop playing</h3>



<p>If you stop playing or temporarily disable your account, without taking any further steps or asking us to
permanently delete your account or personal information, we will keep your information as long as needed to
ensure the integrity of the game and the enjoyment of other players. Your geocache and trackable logs and any
images associated with them will remain as part of the historic record of the geocache or trackable with which
they are associated unless you delete them. If you have provided personal information or content that other
users need to use in relation to the services (for example, information about a particular geocache you have
logged or placed; if you have moved or logged a particular trackable; or if you have left instructions or goals
about a particular trackable), we may retain that information for as long as we need to provide the services to
our other users, but you may always delete that information if you wish. We know that sometimes users take a
break from the game and come back at a later time, which is why we don’t automatically permanently delete your
account and personal information if you stop playing or temporarily disable your account. We may contact you if
you have stopped playing or temporarily disabled your account to check if you would like us to permanently
delete your information. However, after three years of inactivity, we may delete your account without contacting
you, if you created an account and never took any other action in the game.</p>



<p>Please note that once your account and personal information has been deleted we cannot get it back. If you
don’t ask us to permanently delete your account and personal information, except as provided above, we will keep
it until you want to reactivate your account, and we will store it securely and in accordance with this privacy
policy.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="information-provided-for-a-specific-purpose">Information provided for a specific purpose</h3>



<p>If you have provided us with personal information for a specific purpose, we will keep your personal
information for as long as we need to fulfill that purpose. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>If you have provided address information as part of a competition entry, we will keep that information for
          as long as necessary to administer the competition, typically about a year.
        </li><li>We will retain your contact details if you have an account with us or if we think you may be interested in
          marketing messages, offers, promotions, or new services. You will always have the choice of opting out of
          receiving these messages. If you do so, we will remove you from our email marketing lists as soon as we can
          but within 10 business days.
        </li><li>If you have posted content online in the discussion forums, unless you request deletion, we will retain that
          content for as long as we think the topic is relevant. After this time, we may delete the post or archive it.
        </li></ul>



<p>Where we have obtained personal information automatically about your use of our services (e.g. analytics), we
will keep this information for as long as we feel it may be useful to us to improve and develop our business. We
will delete it when it is no longer useful. This will normally be within 24 months of completion of the purpose
for which it was originally collected.</p>



<p>In some cases, we may be required to store personal information beyond the period of time that we need it for
the purposes for which we have collected it, taking into account factors including:</p>



<ul><li>legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain personal information for a certain period of time (e.g.
          compliance with tax and accounting requirements).
        </li><li>the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (e.g., for the purposes of a potential dispute).
        </li></ul>



<p>If a law requires us to hold onto your personal information, we will store your data for the amount of time
required by that law. Further, we will store your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interest,
such as the requirement to create proper documentation of our business operations.</p>



<h2 class="section-anchor" data-rank="2" id="protection-of-your-personal-information">PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>



<p>We have implemented many security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your
information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality
of your information, you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We and
our payment card processors work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission
through the use of transport layer security (TLS), which encrypts the information you input.</p>

    and our non-EEA service providers will store and access your personal information in the U.S. This means that if
    you live outside of the U.S, your personal information will be transferred out of your home country to the U.S.
    for processing and storage by us and our service providers. Please note that the U.S. may not provide equivalent
    levels of data protection as enjoyed in your home jurisdiction. For example, there is currently no adequacy
    decision of the EU Commission that the U.S. can ensure an adequate level of data protection. Also, we could be
    required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities,
    including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</code></pre>



<p>If you live in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, whenever we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA,
UK, or Switzerland, we will ensure that at least one of the following safeguards is in place:</p>



<ul><li>The country is one that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection
          for personal information;
        </li><li>The transfer is subject to a specific derogation in the GDPR or national laws;</li><li>Through the use of the standard data protection clauses as adopted by the EU Commission as the transfer
          mechanism when a case-by-case analysis has been performed;
        </li><li>Where the transfer is to a place or by a method or in circumstances that is regarded by the European
          Commission as providing adequate protection for your personal information; or
        </li><li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification
          mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal information substantially similar
          protection as in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland.
        </li></ul>

<h2 class="section-anchor" data-rank="2" id="privacy-shield-policy">PRIVACY SHIELD POLICY</h2>



<p>This Privacy Shield Policy (“Policy”) applies to all personal data transferred to Groundspeak, Inc.
(“Groundspeak”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) from the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the member states of
the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and Switzerland. This Policy sets out our
practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that personal data.</p>



<p>Privacy Shield is no longer a legal mechanism for transfers outside of the EEA. As a result, we rely on one of
the other legal mechanisms for transfer identified above in “Transfers of Your Personal Information.” We
maintain our Privacy Shield certification for the purpose of providing you with a means to enforce your rights
through the US government in addition to whatever means you may have through your local supervisory authority.
Continuing to certify to Privacy Shield also provides you with clarity about the standards we uphold.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="definitions">Definitions</h3>



<p>For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions apply:</p>



<p>“<strong>Agent</strong>” means any third party that collects or uses personal data under the instructions of,
and solely for, Groundspeak or to which Groundspeak discloses personal data for use on Groundspeak’s behalf.</p>



<p>“<strong>Groundspeak</strong>” means Groundspeak, Inc., which does business as Geocaching and Geocaching HQ,
and any predecessors and successors in the United States.</p>



<p>“<strong>Personal data</strong>” means any data or set of data that identifies or could be used by or on behalf
of Groundspeak to identify (together with other data) a living individual. Personal data does not include data
that is anonymized or aggregated.</p>



<p>“<strong>Sensitive data</strong>” means any personal data that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions,
religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of
uniquely identifying a natural person, data that concerns health or sex life, or data about criminal or
administrative proceedings and sanctions.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="euus-and-swissus-privacy-shield">EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield</h3>



<p>Groundspeak complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU/Switzerland to the
U.S., respectively. We also comply with the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (collectively, “Frameworks”).</p>



<p>Groundspeak has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (“the Privacy Shield Principles”) which are the basis for the principles of this Policy. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="principles">Principles</h3>



<h4 class="section-anchor" data-rank="4" id="notice">Notice</h4>



<p>Groundspeak receives personal data about individuals in the EU and Switzerland collected by Groundspeak and
partners who promote geocaching and/or use geocaching to promote their products or locations in those countries.
Groundspeak uses this personal data to provide services enabling individuals to participate in location-based
play and customer support, information updates and purchases related to such services and in geocaching-related
promotions. This data also facilitates our partners’ participation in geocaching-related marketing and
promotions and enables partners to develop other geocaching services.</p>



<h4 class="section-anchor" data-rank="4" id="choice">Choice</h4>



<p>Groundspeak will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their data is to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. An individual may opt-out of such uses of their personal data by contacting us in the “<a href="#how-to-contact-us">How to Contact Us</a>” section or by using our <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=request" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web form</a>.</p>



<p>Groundspeak will not use sensitive personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was
originally collected, or subsequently authorized by the individual, without first receiving the individual’s
affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in). Groundspeak will treat as sensitive any personal data received from a
third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive.</p>



<h4 class="section-anchor" data-rank="4" id="accountability-for-onward-transfer">Accountability for Onward Transfer</h4>



<p>Groundspeak may employ third parties to manage its IT infrastructure, provide credit card processing and
customer support, perform analytics, and manage its email service. These entities may have access to personal
information if needed to perform their functions for Groundspeak.</p>



<p>Groundspeak may also disclose personal data – such as profile information, geocaches and Adventure Labs and associated logs – to non-agent third parties by licensing its application program interface (API) to partners who use it to develop other geocaching-related applications and services. If you wish to opt-out of transfers to such non-agent third parties, please contact us in the “<a href="#how-to-contact-us">How to Contact Us</a>” section or by using our <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=request" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web form</a> or change your authorizations in account Settings to stop such sharing of data.</p>



<p>Groundspeak may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by
public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>



<p>For data received under one of the Frameworks, Groundspeak will obtain appropriate assurances from its agents
that they will safeguard personal data consistent with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may
be provided by agents include the following: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level
of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield, its own Privacy Shield certification, or another European
Commission adequacy finding.</p>



<p>Groundspeak’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently
transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Groundspeak remains
responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the
personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Groundspeak proves that
it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>



<h4 class="section-anchor" data-rank="4" id="security">Security</h4>



<p>Groundspeak will take reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect personal data in its possession from
loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>



<h4 class="section-anchor" data-rank="4" id="data-integrity-and-purpose-limitation">Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation</h4>



<p>Groundspeak will use personal data only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was
collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to ensure that
personal data is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p>



<h4 class="section-anchor" data-rank="4" id="access">Access</h4>



<p>Upon request, Groundspeak will grant individuals reasonable access to personal data that it holds about them. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete personal data that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may request access to their data, or otherwise correct, amend, or delete their personal data by contacting us in the “<a href="#how-to-contact-us">How to Contact Us</a>” section or by using our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=request" target="_blank">web form</a> or by making changes to their Account Settings.</p>



<h4 class="section-anchor" data-rank="4" id="recourse-enforcement-and-liability">Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability</h4>



<p>In compliance with the applicable Framework, Groundspeak commits to resolve complaints about privacy and personal data collection or use. EU or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Policy should first contact us in the “<a href="#how-to-contact-us">How to Contact Us</a>” section or by using our <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=request" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web form</a>. Groundspeak will investigate and attempt to resolve such complaints by reference to the principles contained in this Policy.</p>



<p>Groundspeak&nbsp;has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit&nbsp;https://bbbprograms.org/privacy-shield-complaints/ for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.</p>



<p>Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a
binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.</p>



<p>Groundspeak is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>



<p>Groundspeak will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this
Policy. Any employee that Groundspeak determines is in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary
action.</p>



<h4 class="section-anchor" data-rank="4" id="limitations">Limitations</h4>



<p>Groundspeak may also be required to disclose an individual’s personal data in response to a lawful request by
public authorities or in connection with a legal obligation. Adherence by Groundspeak to these Privacy Shield
Principles may also be limited to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law
enforcement obligations, and to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>



<h2 class="section-anchor" data-rank="2" id="california-privacy-notice">CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE</h2>



<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain
disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “Personal Information,” as well as rights to access
and control Personal Information. The CCPA defines “Personal Information” to mean “information that identifies,
relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or
indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA
because it is considered public information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a
federal privacy law, such as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p>



<p>To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our
practices, and your rights are described below.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="right-to-access-information">Right to Access Information</h3>

before we can act on your request.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="right-to-request-deletion-of-information">Right to Request Deletion of Information</h3>



<p>You have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete any Personal Information that we have
collected directly from you. To protect our customers’ Personal Information, we are required to verify your
identity before we can act on your request. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with
your request, or why we may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain
that to you in our response.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="right-to-opt-out-of-sale-of-personal-information-to-third-parties">Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information to Third Parties</h3>



<p>You have the right to opt out of any sale of your personal information by Groundspeak to third parties. If you
are a California resident, to exercise this right, please visit our “<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/account/documents/donotsell">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>” page on
the Geocaching.com website or in our mobile application settings. Please note that your right to opt out does
not apply to our sharing of personal information with service providers, who are parties we engage to perform a
function on our behalf and are contractually obligated to use the personal information only for that function.</p>



<h3 class="section-anchor" data-rank="3" id="your-california-privacy-rights">Your California Privacy Rights</h3>



<p>Residents of the State of California also have the right to request information regarding third parties to whom
we have disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties’
direct marketing purposes.</p>
