<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><strong><em>How can you manage your cookies?</em></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;">You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies whenever you like, but please remember if you do choose to reject cookies, your access to some of the functionality and areas of our site may be restricted.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><strong><em>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</em></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;">Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to sites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether users are even aware of them. Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, sites should do when they receive such signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess our sites’ responses to these signals and make appropriate updates to this Cookie Statement.</p>
