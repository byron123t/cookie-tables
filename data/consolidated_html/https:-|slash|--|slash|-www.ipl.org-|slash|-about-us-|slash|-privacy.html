  This Privacy Policy describes how Student Brands, LLC or any of their affiliates or subsidiary companies (here defined
  collectively, “Student Brands,” “we,” “us,” “our”), collect, use and
  process your information. When you purchase products from, register on or use our sites where this Privacy Policy is

      websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties (collectively,
      “Third-Party Services”) which require, information that may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>your name, email address, username, password, address, postal code, phone number, credit card number, gender,
        school attending, graduation year, and other registration information;</li>
      <li>transaction-related information, such as your orders for any Services, downloads or other features, or
        purchases, if any, that you make from us;</li>
      <li>information you otherwise provide us, such as when you contact us (e.g., for help); and</li>
      <li>other information related to your use of certain offerings on our Services.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Information Collected Automatically.</h3>
    <p>We, our Service Providers, or Third-Party Services may automatically receive or collect certain information from
      you when you use the Services. This information may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your browser or operating system;</li>
      <li>your manner of connecting to the Internet (including the browser and/or type of device you are using) and the
        name of your Internet service provider or wireless carrier;</li>
      <li>your Internet protocol (“IP”) address;</li>
      <li>data relating to malfunctions or problems that occur when you use the Services;</li>
      <li>log file information, including your Web request, IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs,
        number of clicks and how you interact with links on our Services, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and
        other such information; and</li>
      <li>information collected by cookies, which are Cookies are small pieces of information or text files that a
        website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on your
        computer's hard drive, and other tracking technologies, including but not limited to, web beacons (also known as
        “tracking pixels”), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device
        recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed
        (“Tracking Technologies”) may be used to collect information about interactions with the Services or
        emails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. Cookies make Web-surfing and browsing
        easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use the saved information to facilitate and improve
        your use of the Services.
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>You can adjust your Internet browsers to reject cookies. However, if you disable the cookies on your
            computer you may not be able to use certain features of the Services and disabling cookies may invalidate
            opt outs that rely on cookies to function.</li>
          <li>We may use cookies to improve the quality of our Services, store user preferences, store and retrieve
            login information on a user's system, and to personalize content and offers of interest to our users.</li>
          <li>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track”
            signal to websites and online services you visit; such signals may prevent third parties from collecting
            information about your online activities over time and across different websites. California law requires us
            to disclose how the Services respond to these kinds of “Do Not Track” signals. Like many
            websites, the Services currently are not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals from
            visitors' browsers. To learn more about “Do Not Track” you may wish to visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">this site</a>.</li>
          <li>We will treat information that does not personally identify you as non-personal information, and we may
            de-identify, anonymize or otherwise convert your personal information to non-personal information. As
            permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to use, process, share and otherwise exploit your
            non-personal information without limitation.</li>
          <li>See our <a href="#cookie-declaration">Cookie Disclosure</a>, below, for more information.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Information Collected Through the Apps.</h3>
    <p>Depending on your personal device and App permission settings, when using the Apps, we may collect or have access
      to the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Stored information and files</b>. These may allow the Apps to read, modify, or delete the contents of your
        USB storage including photographs and video clips.</li>
      <li><b>Camera</b>. This may allow the Apps to take photos or videos for you.</li>
      <li><b>Other</b>. The Apps will send and receive data to and from the Internet, and may view network connections,
        have full network access, or prevent your device from sleeping.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <h3 class="no-padding-top">Our Use of Your Information.</h3>

        deliver our Services and features desired by you (including any customization features requested by you);</li>
      <li>improve our Services;</li>
      <li>fulfill other purposes disclosed to you at the time you provide us with your information or otherwise where we
        are legally permitted to do so;</li>
      <li>personalize content and offers and serve you advertising that may be of interest to you;</li>

    <ul>
      <li>with our Service Providers in connection with their work on our behalf;</li>
      <li>with our family of Student Brands affiliates who may have content and offers of interest to you. We do not
        share your personal information to non-affiliate third parties for marketing purposes unless expressly
        authorized by you;</li>
      <li>if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our terms of use or other applicable terms or policies, or to
        protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Student Brands, the Services, or its users,
        or any third party;</li>
      <li>in the event of a change of ownership, as described below;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Student Brands may implement Google's Invisible reCAPTCHA technology on our Sites in order to reduce spam and
      prevent abuse of our Sites. Your use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is subject to the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.</h3>
<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”), including any Promotion
  jointly sponsored or offered by third parties, which may require submitting your information. If you voluntarily
  choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including personal information, may be disclosed to Student Brands,
  Promotion co-sponsors, Service Providers, and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as
  required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that
  Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data practices that will take precedence over those
  contained in this Privacy Policy in case of a conflict. Please review those official rules carefully.</p>

<h3>4. Information You Disclose Publicly or to Others.</h3>
<p>The Services may permit you to post or submit User Generated Content (“UGC”) including, without
  limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other
  content, including personal information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Services, your UGC will
  be considered “public” and will be accessible by anyone, including Student Brands. Notwithstanding
  anything to the contrary, unless otherwise explicitly agreed by us, personal information included in UGC is not
  subject to our usage or sharing limitations, or other obligations, and may be used and shared by Student Brands and
  third parties to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law. We encourage you to exercise caution when making
  decisions about what you disclose in such public areas. For more information on how UGC is treated under the Services'
  Terms of Use click <a href="/about-us/terms" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.ipl.org/about-us/terms</a>.
</p>
<p>California minors should see the “Minors” section below regarding potential removal of certain UGC they
  have posted on the Services.</p>

<h3>5. Third-Party Content, Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics.</h3>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <h3 class="no-padding-top">Third-Party Services.</h3>
    <ul class="no-padding-left">
      <li>Third-Party Services may use their own Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you
        and may solicit personal information from you. For example, Student Brands maintains its own branded pages on
        various social networks. When you visit these branded social media pages, the provider of the social network and
        other Third-Party Services may set Tracking Technologies on your browser or device.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Social Features.</h3>
    <ul class="no-padding-left">
      <li>Certain functionalities on the Services may permit interactions that you initiate between the Services and
        certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks (“Social Features”). Examples of
        Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Services and a
        Third-Party Services; “liking” or “sharing” Student Brands content; logging in to the
        Services using your Third-Party Services account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Services); and
        to otherwise connect the Services to a Third-Party Services (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the
        Services). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or
        provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Services (see “Information You Disclose Publicly or to
        Others” section above) or by the Third-Party Services that you use. Similarly, if you post information on
        a third-party service that references the Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Student Brands or
        its affiliates in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Services or
        otherwise by Student Brands and its affiliates. Also, both Student Brands and the third party may have access to
        certain information about you and your use of the Services and any Third-Party Services.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Advertising.</h3>
    <ul class="no-padding-left">
      <li>We may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services
        and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing,
        across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device
        usage, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral
        advertising” (“Interest-based Advertising”), which may include sending you an ad on a
        third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., “retargeting”). Our advertisers' and ad
        networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Your Tracking Technologies Choices.</h3>
    <ul class="no-padding-left">
      <li>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers,
        and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different
        functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not
        be effective with regard to some Tracking Technologies, such as HTML5 cookies. Please be aware that if you
        disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the
        Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and
        limitations.</li>
      <li>Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a
        mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your
        operating system or handset manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad
        tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.</li>
      <li>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online
        services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not
        Track” means in this context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we
        receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about “Do Not
        Track,” you can visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of
        this third-party information. You have the right to request information from us about the Services that
        currently do not respond to "do not track" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us
        according to the “How to Contact Us” section below.</li>
      <li>Many advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's (“DAA”) Self- Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising for DAA members, visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">here</a> for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You can also go to <a href="https://www.nextroll.com/privacy" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">here</a> to adjust your advertising preferences with our service provider, NextRoll, Inc. (which used to be called AdRoll), or <a href="https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">here</a> to opt out of the use of your data by one of our other service providers, LiveRamp.</li>
      <li>Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may
        continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should
        no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any
        targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject
        cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or
        web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may not,
        or may no longer, be effective.</li>
      <li>We support the ad industry's 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<a href="https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>) and expect that
        ad networks that we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot
        guaranty their compliance. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any
        third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</li>
      <li>In addition, we may serve ads on third-party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that
        are also identified on one of more of our databases (“Matched List Ads”). This is done by using
        Tracking Technologies, or by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party
        services. We are not responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of
        the data. We are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions
        as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may change their options
        without notice to us or you.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Analytics.</h3>
    <ul class="no-padding-left">
      <li>We may use Third-Party Services such as Google Analytics and Sailthru to help us analyze our performance and
        our delivery of services and advertising to you. For example, we may use Remarketing with Google Analytics,
        Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager and Google Analytics Demographics
        and Interest Reporting.
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>You may exercise your choices regarding the use of cookies by Google Analytics by using the Google
            Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on or by going to <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a> and
            following the instructions.</li>

    <h3 id="caprivacypolicy">Your California Privacy Rights.</h3>
    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides California Consumers certain rights
      regarding their Personal Information (“PI”) as those terms are defined in the CCPA, became
      effective on January 1, 2020.</p>
    <p>We are providing you with notice of the PI we collect and our purposes for that collection for data that may
      be subject to the CCPA (“CCPA Notice”). This CCPA Notice does not cover information that is
      outside of the scope of the CCPA. This notice also does not apply to data collected from employees, applicants
      or contractors or to data collected from individuals acting as representatives of another business in
      connection with business communications or transactions.</p>
    <p>We collect PI directly from you, your device or browser, your education institution, our service providers
      and suppliers, and our corporate affiliates. We use and share PI for the following business purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to provide requested products and Services;</li>
      <li>to advertise and offer new products and services;</li>
      <li>to improve our products and services;</li>
      <li>for quality assurance;</li>
      <li>for research development;</li>
      <li>for prevention of fraud and illegal activity; and</li>
      <li>for marketing purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may also collect, use and share PI for our operational purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We collect the following categories of PI from Consumers which we share with our service providers, agents
      and licensees who perform services on our behalf, with our affiliates, and with your education institution:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>identifiers (e.g., name, phone number, email address, I.P. address);</li>
      <li>personal records (e.g., name, phone number, email address);</li>
      <li>customer account details / commercial information (e.g., your order history);</li>
      <li>internet usage information (e.g., information regarding your interaction with our online services);</li>
      <li>geolocation data (e.g., your general location based on your I.P. address); and</li>
      <li>inferences from PI collected (e.g., your preferences, your performance).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are a California Consumer and would like to register a request under your “right to know about
      personal information collected, disclosed or sold” (including right to obtain copies of specific pieces
      and/or information about categories of PI practices), “right to request deletion of personal
      information,” or “right to opt-out of the sale of personal information,” you can contact us
      at <a href="mailto:californiaprivacy@bned.com">CaliforniaPrivacy@BNED.com</a> or toll-free at 833-729-0427.
      You may opt out of cookies and other tracking technologies by clicking on the CA Do Not Sell My Personal
      Information link at the bottom of this website. You have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment in
      a manner prohibited by the CCPA as a result of your exercising your rights under the CCPA.</p>

    <p>To fulfill your CCPA request, we may require you to provide sufficient information to reasonably verify you
      are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. This verification process includes providing us at least two (2)
      unique data points, depending on the type of request.</p>

    <p>Consumers have the right to exercise CCPA privacy rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency
      requirements of the CCPA. Authorized agent requests must include a copy of the agency agreement between the
      authorized agent and the consumer. We will ask the consumer to independently confirm the agency relationship.
    </p>

    <h3>The Right to Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Categories.</b> You have the right, subject to statutory exceptions, to send us a request, no more
          than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior
          to the request date:</p>
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>The categories of PI we have collected about you.</li>
          <li>The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.</li>
          <li>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your PI.</li>
          <li>The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.</li>
          <li>A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no
            disclosure occurred.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Specific Pieces.</b> You have the right, subject to statutory exceptions, to make or obtain a
          transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the
          period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Right to Deletion</h3>
    <p>You have the right, subject to statutory exceptions, to request that we delete your PI that we have collected
      directly from you and are maintaining. Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not
      collect directly from you.</p>
    <p>You may alternatively exercise more limited control of your PI by instead by canceling or modifying our email
      marketing communications you receive from us. You can do so by following the instructions contained within our
      promotional emails.</p>

    <h3>The Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We do not “sell” PI that we collect from you, including PI of minors under the age of 16, in
      accordance with the definition of “sell” in the CCPA. We treat all PI that we collect from you as
      subject to a “do not sell” request.</p>

    <h3>Your Nevada Privacy Rights.</h3>
    <p>Your Nevada Privacy Rights. Under Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the sale of certain “covered
      information” collected by operators of websites or online services. We currently do not sell covered
      information, as “sale” is defined by such law, and we don't have plans to sell this information.
      However, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell Personal Information covered by this
      Nevada law, please email your name and email address to <a href="mailto:NevadaPrivacy@bned.com">NevadaPrivacy@bned.com</a> to provide your name and email address. You are
      responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to
      cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other purposes. We will maintain this
      information and contact you if our plans change. At that time, we will create a process for verifying your
      identity and providing an opportunity to verified consumers to complete their opt-out. Please become familiar with
      our data practices as set forth in this privacy policy. We may share your data as explained in this privacy
      policy, such as to enhance your experiences and our services, and those activities will be unaffected by a Nevada
      do not sell request. You may also have other choices regarding our data practices as set forth elsewhere in this
      privacy policy.</p>
