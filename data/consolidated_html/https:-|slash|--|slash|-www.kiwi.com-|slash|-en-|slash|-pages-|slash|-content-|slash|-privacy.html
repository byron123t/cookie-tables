<strong>Ordering &amp; Provision of services</strong> </td>
<td>The main reason we collect and use your Personal Data is to conclude an agreement with you and to provide you the services you have ordered. Depending on the extent to which you use our services, we will process your Personal Data in a way that is necessary to enter into and fulfill our Service Agreement as described in our Terms &amp; Conditions. The services that we provide include, primarily, the brokering of a contract of carriage and related services between you and the selected carrier. We may also process your Personal Data for this purpose when providing you with the service of enforcement of your claims against carriers.<br>To achieve this purpose, we need to share your Personal Data with the carriers with whom you will enter into a contract of carriage and, in some cases, also with operators of ticket marketplaces, such as the Global Distribution Systems. Additionally, to pay for the tickets, we will use your name and surname to generate a single-use virtual payment card, which we use for the financial settlement with the transport provider.<br>If you order additional service Special assistance or when you ask us for a refund due to health issues, we will process your Personal Data concerning health. In the case of the Special assistance service, we will share it with the carrier of your choice. During the ordering process, you will be asked to give your explicit consent with the processing of this Personal Data. You can always withdraw your consent through this form: kiwi.com/privacy/rights. However, please note that if you withdraw the consent with the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of the Special Assistance additional service, we won't be able to provide you with any subsequent support related to this service.<br>It may also happen that you choose to order another service that we or our partners offer on our website or in our app, such as insurance or accommodation. We will process your Personal Data as required to enter into a contract with you and to provide you with the ordered service or (if the service is provided by our partner) to enable you to enter into the contract with the service provider and to do our part in the contractual relationship between you and the third-party service provider. You can find the complete list of third-party Data Controllers that we might share your data with below.</td>

<td><strong>Fraud prevention</strong></td>
<td>When you book a ticket or order any other service through our website or app, during the payment transaction, we use a third-party service that helps us prevent fraudulent behavior. This is a very common process that happens nearly every time you order something online. For this to be possible, we will transfer your Personal Data momentarily to a third-party provider of fraud-checking service. However, this is not something to worry about, the whole transaction is completely secure, and we use one of the best and most common fraud-prevention tools. These third-party service providers (currently we use products from the companies Forter, Inc. and Riskified Ltd.) use the Personal Data, which they collect to build a database of online fraudulent behavior. They then compare this database with the behavior of the end-users of their clients, and whenever they detect similar behavioral signs, they can tell the clients to reject payments done by fraudsters.<br>Furthermore, to prevent attempts for fraudulent chargebacks, if you report fraudulent purchase through your bank, we might check your social media to see, whether you have some sort of connection to the person who ordered the ticket to make sure that it is not an attempt to get the money for the ticket back by fraud. We will only process limited information about your connection to the person, who ordered the ticket, and whether you, by any chance, have not published some information connected to the journey (e.g., photos from the airport taking a flight).</td>

<strong>Customer support</strong> </td>
<td>Customer support is a big part of our services. We will record all of our communication through all channels, such as email, chat, and phone calls, in order to provide you with the service that you require. Part of our customer support is also helping our customers with potential legal issues with the carriers (in case of missed flights and similar situations). For this, we have partnered with a third-party service provider. When you have a legal problem, we will send this provider your email address, and you will be contacted with an offer to help you exercise your claims. You can learn more about the sharing of your Personal Data with third-party data controllers here.</td>

<td>We need to process some of your Personal Data to fulfill certain legal obligations that are applicable to us. Because this is a legal necessity, we do not need to obtain your consent for it. For this purpose, we will process your identification and contact information and information about your bookings. The main legal obligations we need to do this for arise from Act No. 89/2012 Coll, the Civil Code, Act No. 634/1992 Coll, on the protection of consumers, Act No. 235/2004 Coll, on Value Added Tax and Act. 563/1991 Coll, on Accounting.
