The collection, use and disclosure of such Sensitive Personal Information is necessary to provide some of our service to you.</p>

<h2>Biometric Information</h2>

<p>We cooperate with third-party service providers to help verify your identity and age and to check the authenticity of any identification documents you provide using facial recognition technology. The facial recognition technology creates a mathematical representation of your face and detects facial features from the live scan of your face, your selfie, and the government-issued ID you submit or have previously submitted to us. This mathematical representation, which is considered biometric information/identifier/data under the laws of certain states and countries, is not shared by our service providers with us, and is deleted by our service providers seven (7) days after its creation. Information derived from this mathematical representation, which may be considered biometric information/identifier/data under the laws of certain states and countries is shared by our service providers with us and is subsequently deleted by us, as further described below.</p>
<p>Your biometric information will be used to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>verify you are a real, live person and to prevent the use of methods which would allow a user to identify as someone else.</li>
	<li>match your selfie with your government-issued ID which you will submit or have previously submitted to us to make sure that nobody is impersonating you.</li>
	<li>help confirm your age.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may disclose your biometric information, face scan, selfie, and government-issued ID (including any government-issued ID or selfie you previously submitted to us) within members of our corporate group, and with third-party service providers. These entities may be located in jurisdictions that do not offer the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction.  We, and any of these entities, may perform facial recognition and collect your biometric information from your face scan, selfie, and any government-issued ID, and use your biometric information for the above purposes.</p>
<p>Biometric information shared by our service providers with us will be stored for as long as you maintain an account on the Website.  We will delete your biometric information within three (3) years of you deleting your account of the Website, or withdrawing your consent, subject to any legal obligations we may have.  </p>
<p>You will be asked to provide your consent to biometric processing, which you may withdraw your consent to at any time by using the links below. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any collection, use, processing, or disclosure that occurred prior to the withdrawal.</p>

	<li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>. Pages of our Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs)&nbsp;that are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in an email)&nbsp;and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</li>
	<li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We use third party analytics and advertising tools and technologies, in particular Google Analytics and DoubleClick provided by Google, Inc., USA (“Google”). These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device identifiers, and other similar information via the use of cookies. The information generated by Google Analytics and DoubleClick about your use of the Website (including your IP address)&nbsp;may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Because we activated IP anonymization for Google Analytics and Double Click, Google will anonymize the last octet of a particular IP address. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity and managing advertising content. To learn how you can opt out from this information collection by Google see “<i>Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information</i>” below.</li>
