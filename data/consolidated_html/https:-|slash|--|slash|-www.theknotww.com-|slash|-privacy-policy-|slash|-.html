<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B. COOKIES AND ONLINE ANALYTICS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a variety of online tracking and analytics tools (e.g., cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, and HTML5) to collect and analyze information as you use the Services. Among other things, these technologies allow us to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing and usage preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics, Coremetrics, Mixpanel, and Segment) on our Services to collect and analyze information collected through these technologies to assist us in auditing, research, or reporting; fraud prevention; and providing certain features to you. To find out more about how your usage information is collected through the practices of, and how you may be able to opt out of certain information by, such third parties, click <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.theknot.com/third-party-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>. The types of tracking and analytics tools we and our service providers use for these purposes are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>“Cookies”</strong> are small data files stored on your computer or device to collect information about your use of the Cookies may enable us to recognize you as the same user who used our Services in the past, and relate your use of the Services to other information we have about you. Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Services (for example, by storing your username) and/or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, limit your use of our Services or features.

	<li><strong>“Local shared objects,”</strong> or <strong>“flash cookies,”</strong> may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other Local shared objects operate much like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings.

	<li>A <strong>“pixel tag”</strong> (also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our web pages.</li>
	<li><strong>“HTML5”</strong> (the language some websites, such as mobile websites, are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your usage of the Services so that we may improve and customize them for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C. ONLINE ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Online Advertising Overview</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a></span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a></span>, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Online Choices</a></span> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ads Settings page</a></span>. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Mobile Advertising</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using mobile applications from TKWW or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.</p>
<p>You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Notice Concerning Do Not Track.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for online advertising and analytics purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.

In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law.

We will let you know where this is the case or if certain rights don’t apply in your country or state of residence. We may request you provide us with information necessary to verify your identity before responding to your request as required or permitted by applicable law. If you are a California resident, please see the “Privacy Information for California Residents” section immediately below for information about your specific rights under California law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>H. PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding your rights with respect to your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>A. Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CCPA Rights Disclosure</span>. If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information.</li>
	<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.</li>
	<li>Delete certain personal information we have about you.</li>
	<li>Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.</p>
<p>Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you. We also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, and other account information. You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request. If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please use the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://theknotww.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000590952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online web form</a></span> or contact us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:ccparequests@theknotww.com">ccparequests@theknotww.com</a></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>B. Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. California law broadly defines “sale” in a way that may include when we share your information with third parties to provide you with offers and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. It also may include allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies, IP address, and/or browsing behavior, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other services. Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you.</p>
<p>Depending on what Services you use, we may provide the following categories of personal information to third parties for these purposes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>For online targeted advertising purposes: demographic and statistical information, user-generated content, device information and identifiers, connection and usage data, geolocation, and social media information.</li>
	<li>For sharing with third parties to send you relevant offers and promotions: contact and account registration information; demographic and statistical information, user-generated content, and geolocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to opt out of TKWW’s use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://theknotww.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000590371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a></span>. You can also submit a sale opt-out request by emailing us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:ccpadonotsell@theknotww.com">ccpadonotsell@theknotww.com</a></span>. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>C. California “Shine the Light” Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you would like to opt out of such sharing, please use the sale opt out form noted above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I. PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, and phone number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. As discussed above, we share your information with certain third parties that we believe can provide you with offers and promotions for products and services of interest to you. In some circumstances, this sharing may qualify as a sale under Nevada law. If you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of such activity emailing us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:nevadarequests@theknotww.com">nevadarequests@theknotww.com</a></span>. Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>J. THIRD PARTY LINKS AND FEATURES</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services may contain links, banners, widgets or advertisements (e.g., a “Share It!” or “Like” button) that lead to other websites, apps, or services not subject to this Privacy Policy (including other sites that may be co-branded with our brands). On some of our Services, you may also be able to register with or purchase directly from third-party retailers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other websites to which the Services link or which link to our Services. The privacy policies of these other sites will govern the collection and use of your information thereon, and we encourage you to read each such policy to learn about how your information may be treated by others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>K. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services are intended for general audiences and not for children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13 without legally-valid parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>L. INTERNATIONAL USERS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Services are targeted to individuals located in the United States and Canada. Please note that in providing services to you, your information will be transferred to the United States. Moreover, TKWW may subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise share your data with, other members within the TKWW group, trusted service providers, and trusted business partners located in countries other than your country of residence, in accordance with applicable law. Such third parties may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of Services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the provision of support services. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use. Please see Bodas.net for access to sites focused on Europe, Latin America, and India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you live in the EEA, please note that if we provide any information about you to any non-EEA members of our group or third-party information processors, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures include signing Standard Contractual Clauses in accordance with EU and other data protection laws to govern the transfers of such data. For more information about these transfer mechanisms, please contact us as detailed in the “TKWW Contact Information” section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>M. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take a variety of physical, technical, administrative, and organizational security measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to, through, or on our Services or via the Internet and that any such transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you sign up for an account, you may be required to establish a username and password. If you create an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs under your account. We are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use messaging or call features that allow you to interact with events vendors and others directly through our Services, please note that for security purposes, you should not include any passwords, social security numbers, payment card information, or other sensitive information in such communications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>N. RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We store and maintain your information for the purposes for which it is processed by us. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>O. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the Services, so you should review the Policy periodically. You can know if the Privacy Policy has changed since the last time you reviewed it by checking the “Effective Date” included at the beginning of the document. If we make a material change to the Policy, you will be provided with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
