<h4>Information Gathered About You or Your Devices</h4>

<p>We collect information when you access one of the Services and when you subscribe to our email services.</p>

<p><em><strong>Device Information</strong></em><br>
We may collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Services such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Services.</p>

<p><em>IP Address.</em>&nbsp;Your IP address is automatically assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for several purposes, such as security, calculating usage levels, and diagnosing server problems. We also use your IP address to administer our Services by identifying (1) which parts of a Service are most heavily used, (2) where our users come from (i.e., a referring sign or a search engine, etc.), and (3) which portion of our audience comes from within or outside the Tufts network. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable unless we are required to do so under applicable law or court order or authorized to do so under our policies.</p>

<p><em>Physical Location.</em>&nbsp;We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. We may also share your device’s physical location with our service providers to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our service providers may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.</p>

<p><em><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></em><br>
Cookies are small files that are stored on your device and are used to collect and store information. This may include: which pages you see; how long you stay; what you click on our pages; if you visit the website again; and which country and city you are browsing from.</p>

<p><em>Types of Cookies.</em>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<em>session cookie</em>&nbsp;is temporary, linking the actions of a user during any given browser session. When the browser is closed, the cookie is deleted. A permanent cookie, also known as a persistent cookie, is stored for a specific period of time and activates each time the user visits the website that created the cookie. A third-party cookie is placed by a domain other than that of the website the user is visiting. Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p><em>Why we use Cookies</em>. We use session, permanent and third-party cookies for security purposes, to display information more effectively, to understand and save your preferences for future visits and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction, so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. Cookies further allow us to select which of our programs, initiatives, offerings and services are most likely to appeal to you and to display them while you are on the Services.</p>

<p>We may contract with selected third parties to place cookies through the Services to provide us with better insights into the use of the Services or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a user’s online activities over time and across different websites when they use our Services. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>

<p>Some third-party cookies may originate from websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest or other social media services. Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly.</p>

<p><em><strong>Use of Technology to Track Users of Services</strong></em><br><em>Google Analytics</em>. One or more of our Services may also use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to track website statistics. Google Analytics uses cookies and other technologies to track visitor interactions and collects the IP address of website visitors in order to provide us a sense of where our visitors come from. This service may also collect demographic and information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors or reporting IP addresses to us.</p>

<p>We use the information collected to understand how our visitors are using the website and make improvements for a better online experience. We do not use Google Analytics to track or collect personal information (name, email address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information) and we do not associate personal information with web analytics information.</p>

<p>To see the full Google Analytics privacy policy and learn more about its privacy practices, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245" target="_blank">Google Analytics: Safeguarding Your Data</a>. You can opt out of the services by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<p><em>Pixel Tags</em>. One or more of our Services may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons, tags or clear GIFs) that embed graphic files in our Services. These graphic files contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Services, or, in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them.</p>

<p>These small data files or graphic files serve a variety of functions. In some instances, they may be necessary to deliver a particular service. Even when they are not essential to the delivery of a service, they may provide information that enables us to improve the performance and functionality of our services and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. They may also enable us to customize our services and provide advertising messages that are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

<p><em>Adobe Flash Technology.</em>&nbsp;We may use Flash Local Shared Objects (Flash LSOs) and other similar technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.</p>

<p><em><strong>Adjusting Cookie Settings</strong></em><br>

Our Services will issue cookies as soon as you visit the Services, unless your browser cookie settings are adjusted to prevent such an occurrence.</p>

<p><em>Interest-Based Advertisements.</em>&nbsp;Some of our Services engage in online interest-based advertising to enhance your experience and show you advertisements that might interest you. Like many organizations, we and our advertising partners display tailored interest-based advertising on the Services and on third-party platforms using information you make available to us when you interact with our Services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as searching on our Services or visiting other websites, apps or online services that contain our content or ads. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like mobile identifiers, cookies, and pixel tags.</p>

Please note that if you opt out of interest-based advertising, you will still see advertisements – they will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, note that deleting browser cookies can remove the cookie preferences you have made, so you may need to opt-out again in the future.</p>

<hr><h2>Global Privacy Statements</h2>

<h3 id="Global-Privacy">Global Privacy Statement for Personal Data</h3>

<p>This statement provides additional information about our use and processing of your personal data. Some jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations that include notice and other requirements that may apply to your personal data (together, the Privacy Laws). Among those Privacy Laws are the General Data Protection Regulation for the European Economic Area (EEA) (regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament) (the EEA GDPR) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, as tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018 of the UK (the UK GDPR).&nbsp;The Tufts University PIPL Privacy Statement applies to personal information subject to the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) of the People’s Republic of China. Other notices are provided that apply to the personal data of&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Privacy-Statement-for-Prospective-Students-and-Applicants" target="_blank">Prospective Students and Applicants</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy#Privacy_Statement_for_Students" target="_blank">Students</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy#Privacy_Statement_for_Students_in_Tufts-Sponsored_Study_Abroad_Programs" target="_blank">Students in Tufts-Sponsored Study Abroad Programs</a>;&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Privacy-Statement-for-Job-Applicants-Faculty-Staff-Consultants-and-Other-Persons-Providing-Services" target="_blank">Job Applicants, Faculty, Staff, Consultants and Other Persons Providing Services</a>;&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Privacy-Statement-for-Alumni-Donors-and-Other-Tufts-Supporters" target="_blank">Alumni, Donors and other Tufts Supporters</a>;&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Privacy-Statement-for-Research-Participants" target="_blank">Research Participants</a>&nbsp;and for&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Privacy-Statement-for-Online-Education-and-Non-Degree-Educational-Program-Participants" target="_blank">Online Education and Non-Degree Educational Program Participants</a>.</p>

<p>This Notice should be read together with Tufts'&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy#Privacy_Statement" target="_blank">Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

<h4>1. Why have I been directed to this webpage?</h4>

<p>The general information published on this page is intended to supplement specific information that you may have already been given in connection with your engagement with a particular service, facility, event or initiative run by Tufts. You may have been directed here, for example, because you are accessing an optional staff or student service or using a Tufts facility, or because you are using a particular website or online resource, or because you have signed up to attend an event aimed at prospective students or members of the public. The information below is the same for many such situations, and we thought it would be helpful to have it in one place.</p>

<h4>2. What is “personal data” and what does “processing” mean?</h4>

<p>In this notice and in the other specific notices, we use the broad meaning of personal data used in the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR, which define “personal data” as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Other Privacy Laws may include other definitions of personal information or personal data, which may be narrower than this definition or may include very specific types of information.</p>

<p>Many of the Privacy Laws use the word “processing.” “Processing” simply means any way of working with personal data, from collecting it to using it to sharing it to disposing of it.</p>

<h4>3. What are the purposes and lawful bases for processing your personal data?</h4>

<p>Tufts may collect, use and otherwise process personal data about you for several different purposes and legal bases, including:</p>

<ul><li>We need it to perform a contract with you, such as to provide you services.</li>
	<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest, such as to promote and provide goods and services to you and to protect our legal rights and interests. When our purpose is based on our legitimate interest, we consider whether that interest is overridden by your data protection interests.</li>
	<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.</li>
	<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
	<li>We need to process your data in connection with your or another person’s vital interest.</li>
	<li>We need to process your data in connection with the public interest.</li>
	<li>We have another permitted legal basis.</li>
</ul><p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose under the EEA GDPR or the UK GDPR, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose under another of the Privacy Laws, then that Privacy Law may also allow you to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.</p>

<p>Unless you are told otherwise, there is no requirement to supply us with any of your personal data. It is Tufts’ policy to not use personal data to carry out any automated decision-making that affects you without an appropriate legal basis as required by the applicable Privacy Law.</p>

<p><em><strong>Specific information for Services</strong></em></p>

<p>Tufts will process your personal data in connection with tufts.edu and other Tufts University websites (together, a “Site” or “Sites”) that have pointed you to this page, as well as mobile apps and other digital properties (together, a “Service” or the “Services”), for a variety of service- and business-related purposes, including for analyzing and improving website performance; email and other communications; processing you have requested; third-party services; and security and legal requirements.</p>

<p>The use of your personal data in the manner described above and elsewhere in the Privacy Statement are necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its Services, analyzing their use, and ensuring their security. The Services collect limited personal data and we use it in ways that are compatible with your individual rights and freedoms. Where you enter your personal data into an online form on or in connection with any of our Services for any specified purpose, you will be told about the use we will make of that information (e.g., to send you newsletters or to enable your attendance at an event).</p>

<h4>4. If I am outside of the United States, will my personal data be transferred out of the country where I am located or reside?</h4>

<p>Your personal data will be transferred out of the country where you are when it is collected to the USA, which has different privacy laws than those of your country. Your personal data may also be transferred to countries other than the US, which may have different privacy laws than those of your country. Tufts has adopted appropriate measures to protect your personal data. The transfer of your personal data may be necessary for the performance of a contract between you and Tufts, for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest, or for important reasons in the public interest. In limited circumstances, the transfer may be necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, to protect your vital interests, or as otherwise permitted by the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR, or other applicable Privacy Laws.</p>

<h4>5. Will Tufts share my personal data with others?</h4>

<p>We will use reasonable measures to ensure that your personal data are only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the standard of protection required under the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR, or other Privacy Laws, as applicable.</p>

<h4>6. How long will my personal data be kept?</h4>

<p>Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at&nbsp;<a href="https://dca.tufts.edu/records-management/records-retention" target="_blank">Records Retention Schedules</a>.</p>

<h4>7. What rights do I have with respect to my personal data?</h4>

<p>The Privacy Laws of different countries provide specific data protection rights. It is Tufts’ intention to comply with the data protection rights that apply to its processing of personal data under the different Privacy Laws.</p>

<p>Rights Provided by the&nbsp;<em>EEA GDPR</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>&gt;UK GDPR</em></p>

<p>The EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR provide individuals with several specific data protection rights with respect to their personal data. These rights require a particular type of connection to the countries that are part of the EEA or the UK. These rights apply when Tufts processes your personal data:</p>

<ul><li>As part of Tufts acting in an established way in the EEA or UK, respectively,</li>
	<li>In connection with Tufts offering goods or services to you when you are physically in the EEA or the UK, or</li>
	<li>When the processing is related to any monitoring of your behavior when you are physically in the EEA or UK.</li>
</ul><p>The rights provided by the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Subject-Access-Request" target="_blank">How to Make a Subject Access Request</a>. These rights are not absolute and each right is subject to limitations.</p>

<ul><li>The right of access. You have the right to confirmation of the personal data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. Among the limitations for this right is that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.</li>
	<li>The right to correct. You have a right to have inaccurate personal data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.</li>
	<li>The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten). You have a right to have your personal data erased in certain limited circumstances.</li>
	<li>The right to restrict processing and to object to use. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your personal data. This right only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.</li>
	<li>The right to data portability. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your personal data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.</li>
	<li>The right to object. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.</li>
</ul><p><em>Rights Provided under other Privacy Laws</em></p>

<p>As mentioned above, it is Tufts’ intention to comply with the data protection rights that apply to its processing of personal data under the different Privacy Laws. If you wish to exercise a data protection right under one of the Privacy Laws other than the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR, then you can find additional information at&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Subject-Access-Request" target="_blank">How to make a Subject Access Request</a>.</p>

<h4>8. Where can I go if I have questions?</h4>

<p>If you have any questions about how your personal data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights with respect to your personal data, please see&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Subject-Access-Request" target="_blank">How to Make a Subject Access Request</a>&nbsp;or contact Tufts’ Data Privacy Team at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataprivacy@tufts.edu">dataprivacy@tufts.edu</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not happy with the way your personal data is being handled, or with the response received from us, then the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR provide you the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority or commissioner in the country where you habitually reside, where you work, or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.</p>

<p>You may find similar rights under other Privacy Laws.</p>

<h4>9. Changes to this Privacy Statement</h4>

<p>Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this notice at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant. Any such changes will be posted on this page.</p>

<p>This notice was last updated effective on July 9, 2021.</p>

<hr><h3 id="Subject-Access-Request">How to Make a Subject Access Request</h3>

<p>This document provides information about how to submit a request to exercise rights you have with respect to your personal data under privacy laws and regulations (together, the Privacy Laws).</p>

<p>Rights provided by the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR</p>

<p>Among the Privacy Laws that provide specific rights with respect to an individual’s personal data are the General Data Protection Regulation for the European Economic Area (EEA) (the EEA GDPR) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, as tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018 of the UK (the UK GDPR).</p>

<p>Tufts'&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy#Global-Privacy" target="_blank">Global Privacy Statement for Personal Data</a>&nbsp;describes when the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR provide rights applying to an individual’s personal data. For example, if you provide personal data to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or the UK, or while you participate in an established Tufts program that occurs in the EEA or UK, then you would have the following rights under the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR:</p>

<ul><li>The right of access.</li>
	<li>The right to correct.</li>
	<li>The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten).</li>
	<li>The right to restrict processing.</li>
	<li>The right to data portability (to move the data to another party).</li>
	<li>The right to object.</li>
</ul><p>All of these rights are subject to certain exemptions and limitations. More information about these rights may be found in the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR and in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy#Global-Privacy" target="_blank">Global Privacy Statement for Personal Data</a>.</p>

<p>Rights provided under other Privacy Laws</p>

<p>Other Privacy Laws may provide you with certain rights with respect to your personal data. Please be aware that some Privacy Laws do not apply to non-profit institutions. Generally, a Privacy Law will require you to have a specific relationship to the jurisdiction in order to be entitled to exercise a personal data right.</p>

<p>Form for Submitting a Request</p>

<p>Requesting to exercise your rights under the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR, the PIPL or another Privacy Law is known as making a Subject Access Request (sometimes called an SAR). A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/2022-04/SAR-7-2021.pdf">Subject Access Request form</a>&nbsp;is made available for your convenience. The form sets out where you should send your request and asks that you provide us with proof of your identity.</p>

<p>Before we can act on your request, we must:</p>

<ul><li>Confirm your identity</li>
	<li>Be supplied with sufficient information from you in order to locate the information you seek.</li>
</ul><p>On receipt of your completed request, verification of your identity, and sufficient details to enable us to locate the information, we will endeavor to provide you information on our actions promptly. The EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR require that we act on a completed request within one month. That period may be extended by two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.</p>

<p>If we determine not to fulfill your request, we are required to notify you within one month of our reasons for not doing so.</p>

<p>If a person’s data requests are clearly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs or decline to act on the requests.</p>

<p>The following statement has been prepared to provide notice to students whose personal data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University, including its schools, while they are students at Tufts.

<p>This statement should be read together with the&nbsp;<a href="/privacy#Global-Privacy" target="_blank">Global Privacy Statement for Personal Data</a>, which provides information regarding:</p>

	<li>If I am outside of the United States, will my personal data be transferred out of the country where I am located or reside?</li>
	<li>What rights do I have with respect to my personal data?</li>
</ul><p>In addition to the information provided in this statement, students are encouraged to review the information about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for their school. FERPA permits the disclosure of certain personal information classified by a school as “directory” information. See Tufts’&nbsp;<a href="/sites/default/files/2021-07/Updated%20Model%20Policy_FERPA.10.31.2019.pdf">FERPA Policy</a>. Privacy Blocks are available to students who wish to prevent the University from disclosing their directory information (in student directories and commencement programs, for example) by selecting the appropriate privacy settings through SIS.</p>

<h4>1. How does this webpage relate to other information about data protection?</h4>

<p>In addition to the information published here, when you use specific services and facilities offered by Tufts, you may be told about other uses of your personal data.

<p><em>Effective starting May 25, 2018, last revised effective on March 1, 2022.</em></p>

This statement provides notice under the laws and regulations that include notice and other requirements that may apply to your personal data (together, the Privacy Laws).

For information about how Tufts University handles personal information subject to the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) of the People’s Republic of China, see the Tufts University PIPL Privacy Statement.Tufts is committed to processing your personal data in compliance with the Privacy Laws and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the Privacy Laws, including the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR.</p>

</ul><h4>Does this Privacy Statement apply to me as a job applicant, an employee or as a person otherwise providing services to Tufts?</h4>

<p>When you are a job applicant, an employee or other person providing services to Tufts, the EEA GDPR will apply to you in that role only if you will be providing or are providing services in the context of Tufts’ established study abroad programs in the EEA, and the UK GDPR will apply to you only if you will be providing or are providing services in the context of Tufts’ established study abroad programs in the UK. This includes if you will be providing or are providing services outside of the EEA or UK, as well as inside the EEA and the UK, respectively, so long as your services will be or are in connection with one of Tufts’ established EEA or UK study abroad programs, respectively.</p>

<p>It may be the case that the Privacy Laws, including the EEA GDPR or the UK GDPR, apply to your personal data processed by Tufts in other circumstances if you have other relationships and transactions with Tufts. Please see the other Privacy Statements.</p>

<hr><h3 id="#Privacy-Statement-for-Alumni-Donors-and-Other-Tufts-Supporters">Privacy Statement for Alumni, Donors and Other Tufts Supporters</h3>

<p><em>Effective starting May 25, 2018, last revised effective on March 1, 2022.</em></p>

<p>The following Statement has been prepared to provide notice to alumni and donors whose personal data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University, including its schools, in connection with being an alumnus, donor, or other supporter. This statement provides notice under the laws and regulations that include notice and other requirements that may apply to your personal data (together, the Privacy Laws). Among those Privacy Laws are the General Data Protection Regulation for the European Economic Area (EEA) (regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament) (EEA GDPR) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, as tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018 of the UK (the UK GDPR). For information about how Tufts University handles personal information subject to the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) of the People’s Republic of China, see the Tufts University PIPL Privacy Statement. Tufts is committed to processing your personal data in compliance with the Privacy Laws and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the Privacy Laws, including the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR.</p>

<p>This statement should also be read together with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy#Global-Privacy" target="_blank">Global Privacy Statement for Personal Data</a>, which provides information regarding:</p>

<ul><li>What is “personal data” and what does “processing” mean?</li>
	<li>If I am outside of the United States, will my personal data be transferred out of the country where I am located or reside?</li>
	<li>What rights do I have with respect to my personal data?</li>
</ul><p>This Statement discloses the privacy practices for the personal data of Tufts alumni and donors. Please read these terms together with the Privacy Statements found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://alumniandfriends.tufts.edu/privacy-policy-alumni-data" target="_blank">Privacy Policy for Alumni Data</a>.</p>

<p>The Tufts University Alumni Association and the Tufts University Advancement Division respect your right to privacy and will only use your information for university-related purposes. It is Tufts’ policy to use legally required and industry standard methods to secure such data.</p>

<p>This Statement explains how Tufts handles and uses the personal data we collect about our alumni and our past, current and future supporters, whether donors, volunteers or participants in membership groups that we run. “Tufts” in this context means the central university, our individual schools, departments and research institutes, and the libraries and other cultural and recreational facilities that we operate. Developing a better understanding of our alumni, donors and other supporters allows us to keep in touch with you, in order to keep you apprised of our activities and developments, to provide services to you, and to identify ways in which you can support us, through donations or other forms of financial and non-financial support.</p>

<h4>1. Personal data held by Tufts</h4>

<p>We may hold information relating to you from a number of sources. A significant proportion of the personal data we hold on alumni, donors and supporters is provided to us directly (for example, an alumnus may give us information by filling in forms on the Tufts website, or by corresponding with us by telephone, email or otherwise). If you are a student or studied at Tufts, some of your personal information is transferred from your student record to Tufts University Advancement databases.</p>

<p>The information we hold about you may or may not be personal data within the scope of the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR or other Privacy Laws. Among the information records may contain are:</p>

<ul><li>details of your education (e.g. your school(s), areas of study, dates of study)</li>
	<li>unique personal identifiers and biographical information (e.g. student number, date of birth)</li>
	<li>your contact details (and we update these whenever you let us know that they have changed)</li>
	<li>details of your interactions with Tufts, including:
	<ul><li>your membership of clubs, societies, and alumni groups</li>
		<li>your attendance at Tufts events</li>
		<li>other contact with us or our partners</li>
		<li>your relationships with other Tufts alumni, donors or supporters</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>details about your family (e.g. your marital status, the name of your partner or spouse)</li>
	<li>personal data provided by you for a specific purpose (e.g. disability and dietary preferences for event management purposes)</li>
	<li>your communication preferences, to help us provide tailored and relevant communications.</li>
</ul><p>We also record, where applicable, based on information that you provide to us and, in some cases, publicly available information and information from our partners:</p>

<ul><li>financial information relating to you and your family, including:
	<ul><li>your history of donations made to Tufts</li>
		<li>your ability and willingness to make donations, including our assessment of your income and whether particular donations or funding appeals may be of interest to you</li>
		<li>your philanthropy and other giving, including donations to other organizations and other support that you provide (e.g. details of volunteering roles)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>your career highlights and other life achievements</li>
	<li>information about your areas of interest and extra-curricular activities</li>
</ul><p>We augment the data we hold from Tufts with data from our collaborators and publicly available data. We use targeted internet searches and may search the following (either directly or using search engines), where relevant in order to obtain and maintain the accuracy of the data listed above:</p>

<ul><li>Public sources for companies (in order to find personal data of those companies’ employees, etc.), including company websites</li>
	<li>Public sources for charities (in order to find personal data of those charities’ employees, trustees, etc., and to find information about donations and support)</li>
	<li>Public sources for individuals</li>
	<li>Press sources</li>
</ul><p>In addition to this, Tufts may process some personal data about you that is classified as “special category” or sensitive personal data, which requires additional protections. Under the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR, and possibly other Privacy Laws, this includes information concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious beliefs or health/disability that we use for planning purposes, or in order to provide help or suitable assistance. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” personal data are managed very carefully.</p>

<h4>2. How your personal data is used by Tufts</h4>

<p>We may use automated or manual analyses to link personal data together to help us identify your potential for supporting Tufts, to provide you with an improved experience, to send you communications which are relevant and timely, to identify volunteering opportunities or opportunities for providing support which may be of interest to you, and to avoid approaching you with opportunities which are not of interest. All of this enables us to raise more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, in support of Tufts’ strategic research and teaching objectives. We always seek to ensure that any opportunities we present are aligned with your interests, based on the research we conduct.</p>

<p>Your personal data is used by us for a number of interdependent purposes in support of alumni relations, communications and fundraising. These include:</p>

<ul><li>sending you publications, alumni magazines, and news and updates about Tufts</li>
	<li>conducting surveys, including research on when and whether particular donations or funding appeals may be of interest to you</li>
	<li>providing services, including access to Tufts facilities and alumni and donor email accounts</li>
	<li>providing an alumni directory within the password-protected Tufts University Online community</li>
	<li>sending you information about giving opportunities, tailored proposals, appeals and requests for donations</li>
	<li>sending you details of volunteering opportunities</li>
	<li>inviting you to alumni, donor, and other Tufts events</li>
	<li>the promotion of other opportunities and services available to you (e.g. offers and opportunities available through Tufts’ network of alumni, donor and supporter groups)</li>
	<li>wealth analysis and research in order to improve our understanding of our alumni, donors and supporters, inform our fundraising strategy and target our communications more effectively</li>
	<li>internal record keeping, including the management of any feedback or complaints</li>
	<li>administrative purposes (e.g. in order to process a donation you have made or to administer an event you have registered for or attended)</li>
</ul><p>The Tufts University Alumni Association and the Tufts University Advancement Division has also occasionally approved sharing alumni, donor and supporter data with companies and institutions that desire to offer services and benefits to Tufts alumni, donors and supporters at a discounted rate. Any third parties who receive alumni, donor and supporter data for this purpose are prohibited from using or sharing the data for any purpose other than providing services to Tufts or to its alumni, donors and supporters.</p>

<p>Communications to you may be sent by mail, telephone or electronic means, depending on the contact details we hold and the preferences expressed by you about the types of communications you wish to receive. Alumni may at any time opt-out of receiving all emails from the alumni association, or just emails from companies and institutions offering services and benefits to alumni, by clicking on the “update your email subscription preferences” link in emails and following the specified instructions, or by calling 1-800-THE- ALUM (1-800-843-2586) or 617-627-3532, by faxing a request to 617-627-3938, or by mailing a request to Tufts University Alumni Association, 80 George St., Ste. 100-3, Medford, MA 02155.</p>

<h4>3. The purposes and lawful bases for processing your personal data</h4>

<p>The purposes and lawful bases for processing your personal data include being necessary for the pursuit of our legitimate interests, the carrying out of a task in the public interest, and in some instances, the performance of a contract. We always endeavor to handle your personal data securely and minimize its use.</p>

<h4>4. How we protect your personal data</h4>

<p>It is Tufts’ policy to have appropriate data sharing agreements in place before sharing your personal data.</p>

<p>We do not sell your personal data to third parties under any circumstances, or permit third parties to sell the personal data we have shared with them. In addition, it is Tufts policy to prohibit any third party (except those selected by the Tufts University Alumni Association and University Advancement) from using alumni, donor or supporter data for any commercial or business marketing.</p>

<h4>5. How long will my personal data be kept?</h4>

<p>We will retain your personal data indefinitely in support of your lifelong relationship with Tufts or until you request us to do otherwise. Further information about Tufts’ record retention practices can be found at our&nbsp;<a href="https://dca.tufts.edu/records-management/records-retention" target="_blank">Records Retention Schedule</a>.</p>

<h4>6. Where can I go if I have questions?</h4>

<p>Tufts’ schools offer many programs that provide engaging educational experiences without requiring the participants to commit to seeking a degree. Our non-degree educational programs include online, on campus and/or other in person sessions.

Under the Privacy Laws, in some cases personal data may be in scope of the regulation regardless of where you are located when you provide us the information. For example, this is the case for the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR if personal data is provided in the context of the activities of an establishment in the EEA or the UK, respectively. Tufts offers many programs from time to time that may include sessions in other countries, including in the EEA or the UK, but generally we do not consider those programs part of an establishment in those countries. However, for our established Tufts-sponsored Study Abroad programs in the EEA and the UK, we include in personal data all personal information Tufts collects or otherwise processes in the context of those programs.

<h4>3. Will Tufts share my personal data with others?</h4>

<p>Your application and related materials will be shared with the appropriate faculty and staff at Tufts. Each school and program has developed its own practices for sharing your personal information based on its consideration of the type and sensitivity of the personal information, the purpose for which the information was provided or otherwise collected, the purpose for sharing the personal information, and the safeguards used to protect the shared information. Accordingly, under certain, considered circumstances, and when relevant, your personal information may also be shared with:</p>
