A California resident may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of their minor child.A verifiable consumer request for access or data portability can only be made twice within a 12-month period.

We cannot respond to your request or provide personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account on our website.

If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.

The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.Non-discriminationWe will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, and as such, will not, except as permitted by the CCPA, do any of the following as a result of the exercise of your CCPA rights:deny you goods or services.charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.Copy link to clipboardRead more Terms of ServiceData Processing AddendumData ProtectionAcceptable Use PolicyAudit TrailTalk to our technical teamIf you're having technical or account issues just get in touch.Live chat unavailableDon't want to chat?
