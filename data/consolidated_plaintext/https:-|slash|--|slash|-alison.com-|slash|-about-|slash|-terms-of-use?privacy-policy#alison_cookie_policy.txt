As discussed above, We use third-party analytics such as Google Analytics and Hotjar to help understand Your usage of our services and to improve our Service. We may provide Your contact information, Registration Information, Technical Information, Usage Data, or de-identified data or to data enrichment services to such third party analytics and data enrichment service providers, which match such information with publicly available database information, including contact and social information from other sources, such as Your email address, gender, company, job title, photos, website URLs, social network handles and physical addresses. We use this combined information to communicate with You in a more effective and customized manner.
Business Transfers, Sales, Mergers, or Divestitures
In the event that Alison undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, We may share, disclose or transfer all of Your information to the successor organization in such transition or during steps in contemplation of such activities (e.g., due diligence).
With Your Permission
We may share information with Your consent to third parties not within scope of this Privacy Policy.
Aggregate or De-identified Information
We may disclose or use aggregate or de-identified information for any purpose.
Promotions
We may share Your information in connection with any Promotion You enter on or through the Services, as necessary to administer, market, sponsor, or fulfill the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners' lists or make required filings as appropriate) or in accordance with the applicable rules of the Promotion. We may share Your information with a third party assisting us in administering the Promotion.
Advertising of Third Party Products/Services
We may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain Technical Information, Usage Information and/or Aggregate Information to show general demographic and preference information among our Users. We may also allow advertisers to collect Technical Information or Aggregate Information, which they may share with Us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer You targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize Your User experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services You see will appeal to You, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end User activity to improve Your experience).
These third parties include ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content, research firms, and other companies that help us provide more effective advertising. Because your browser, app, or device communicates with the third party’s servers, these companies can collect information, including your IP address, page header information, browser or device information, just as if you had requested their webpage or used their apps directly. These companies may collect information to deliver you customized ads on both Alison and non-Alison websites, applications, and services.
The following third parties offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites. Please visit each company’s privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you.

Alison Cookies Policy
Effective Date: May 17, 2018
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files placed onto your computer or device as you browse the Internet. Cookies can be used to collect, store and share bits of information about your activities across websites and services, including on Alison. They also allow us to remember things about your visit to Alison, such as your preferred language and other choices/settings and generally make the site easier for you to use.
Alison uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to Alison. These cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using Alison. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, such as when you log into Alison. A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time. For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.
Why does Alison use cookies and similar technologies?
Alison uses cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, browser cookies, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use cookies both when you access our site and services on a browser, as well as through our native mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.
We use cookies for the following purposes:
Authentication and security:

To log you into Alison;
To protect your security;
and

To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Alison’s agreements and terms.

For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Alison and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your accounts.
Preferences:

To remember information about your browser and your preferences;
and

To remember your settings and other choices you have made.

For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country that you are in. We can then provide you with content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Alison.
Analytics and research:

To help us improve and understand how people use Alison.

For example, cookies help us test different versions of Alison to see which particular features or content users prefer. We may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Alison by using cookies to see how you interact with Alison, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on.
To help us better understand how people use Alison, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics. These providers use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party Services from which you arrive. The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of Alison. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out plugin by clicking here.
We don’t release the information collected from our own cookies to any third parties, other than to our service providers who assist us in these activities.
Personalized content:

To customize Alison with more relevant content.

Advertising:

To provide you with more relevant advertising.

As explained further in our Privacy Policy, third-parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via Alison may use cookies to collect information about your activities on the Services, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. This information may be used by them to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads. Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google Analytics, Google Adsense and Doubleclick for Publishers as well as other advertising networks and services we use from time to time.
For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit youronlinechoices.eu or allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into Alison, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
When accessing Alison from a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, such as iOS and Android, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or operating system or contact the applicable platform operator.
What are my privacy options?
You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use cookies.

This cookie policy is available at our site.– By continuing to use or access Alison, you are consenting to our use of cookies and related technologies as described in this Cookies Policy.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of Alison.
Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.
For general information about cookies and how to disable them, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

Changes to this Policy
We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on Alison with a new effective date. If we make a material change to this Policy, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in advance of the planned change.

Alison Business

The Alison online learning platform has advertisements as standard. This feature can be removed as a premium service, the cost can be discussed with the API Client's account manager.
Only Alison certification can be sold for Alison courses that are integrated to API Client systems. The API agreement does not allow the API Client to provide their own certification for any Alison course.
The API should only be used for the purposes submitted by the API Client .  Any use beyond this needs to be signed off by Alison. Any unauthorised use outside of the purposes agreed in this contract will lead to immediate disconnecting of the API at no financial loss to Alison.









Refer A Friend

The Alison “Refer a Friend” (“RAF”) Terms and Conditions should be read in conjunction with the Alison Terms of Use. Where there is conflict between the “Refer a Friend” Terms and Conditions and the General Terms of Use, the specific Terms and Conditions from the “Refer a Friend” Programme shall apply, but all other provisions within the General Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.
These terms and conditions (“Terms”) apply to Alison’s Refer a Friend programme (“Programme”). By referring a friend, acting on a referral, using the Programme, or otherwise participating in the Programme, the referring user and/or referred friend agree to be bound by these Terms.


The individual who was issued a RAF unique link by Alison will be considered to be the "Referring User" for all Qualified Referrals made using that RAF unique link.


To be eligible for rewards through the RAF, a Referring User must have a Confirmed Alison account.


The Referring User can share their RAF unique link on social media accounts, email or any other form of communication available to them.


To obtain a referral reward, the Referring User must refer a Qualified Referred Friend.


To be considered a Qualified Referred Friend, the Referred Friend cannot have previously registered on Alison


Referring Users will receive a reward associated with the Programme once three (3) Qualified Referred Friends register successfully on Alison using the unique referral link associated to their account, and each Qualified Referred Friend completes a course on Alison within thirty (30) days of their registration. 


A Referring User will not receive a reward if their referrals: are not considered Qualified Friends for any reason, (including if the Referred Friend does not satisfy the requirements to be considered a Qualified Friend); do not register on Alison using your unique referral link; do not complete a course within thirty (30) days of registering on Alison


Referring Users will be notified by email within 24 hours of becoming eligible for their reward. 


The Stats Page can be used by Referring Users to keep track of their Qualified Referred Friends progress. Please note: the Stats Page can take up to 24 hours to refresh with updated progress.


A Referring User should honour all requests to stop referrals or communications about the Programme.


A Referring User should not engage in any misleading, deceptive, annoying, or harassing practices with respect to referrals or Programme communications.


A Qualified Referred Friend will receive a reward associated with the programme on successful registration on Alison when they use the referral link sent to them by a Referring User. A Referred Friend is only entitled to receive one (1) reward as a Referred Friend.


The rewards associated with the Programme are not cash and cannot be exchanged for cash.


Offer not valid and rewards are not payable for self-referrals and fraudulent transactions. Alison reserves the right to stop any user from using our services who we believe is using a referral campaign in an unethical manner.

Alison uses analytical tools to assess whether a Referred User is attempting to abuse the Programme by creating fake multiple new email addresses and Alison accounts by themselves (and not through Qualified Referred Friends) simply to claim the rewards associated with the Programme. This automatically sets off an alarm within our systems and may cause the Referred User to be disqualified from the Programme, and their Alison account suspended or terminated. Alison reserves the right to make a final decision in this regard.
Alison uses analytical tools to assess whether a Referred Friend has completed a course in the appropriate time. If a Referred Friend 'speed completes' an Alison course to completion, this automatically sets off an alarm within our systems and may cause the Referred Friend to be disqualified from the Programme. Alison reserves the right to make a final decision in this regard.

Spam and the use of Purchased or harvested lists is prohibited and will result in immediate termination of the Referring User’s account and deactivation of RAF links.


Alison reserves the right to cancel, alter, amend, suspend, withdraw or terminate the Refer A Friend Programme or to change these terms and conditions at any time at its sole discretion.


This Refer A Friend (RAF) offer cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer.


The Programme and these terms and conditions will be governed by Irish Law and any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Republic of Ireland (Ireland).











Premium Monthly

Alison provides an optional paid-for (“Fee”) subscription service (“Premium Monthly”, “Premium”, or “Subscription”) that allows our users additional Benefits and Features (“Features”) not available on a standard free account.
 
The Alison “Premium Monthly” (“Premium”) Terms and Conditions should be read in conjunction with the Alison Terms of Use. Where there is conflict between the “Premium” Terms and Conditions and the General Terms of Use, the specific “Premium” Terms and Conditions shall apply, but all other provisions with the General Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.
 
If you buy our paid Subscription (“Premium Monthly”), you agree to pay us the applicable Fee. Failure to pay this Fee will result in the termination of your paid Subscription.
