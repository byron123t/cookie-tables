(Israel) aka Insightera, Inc.; Marketo Corporation Canada; Bizible; ToutApp, Inc.; Zubhium Inc.) on their respective websites (each, a “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”).

 1.   What is a Cookie? 
Cookies are a standard feature of websites that allow us to store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to a Site. Cookies help us to learn which areas of a Site are useful and which areas need improvement. Cookies also improve your experience by, for example, remembering your preferences.
You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser or by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links for the different categories of cookies provided in the Cookie Preference Centers found in the Sites’ footers and Marketo’s cookie banners. However, if you disable this function, your experience on a Site may be diminished and some features will not work as intended depending upon which cookies are disabled.
2. Why do we use Cookies?  
Our Sites uses both 1st party cookies (which are set by the Site being visited) and 3rd party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of a Site). We use 1st party and 3rd party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for the Sites to operate, and we refer to these as "strictly necessary" cookies. Some cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Sites, and we refer to these as "Performance" cookies. Some cookies enable us to provide enhanced functionality and personalization on the Sites and we refer to these as “Functional” cookies. Finally, some cookies enable us and our partners to serve targeted advertisements and we refer to these as “Targeting” cookies. The specific types of 1st and 3rd party cookies served through the Sites and the purposes they perform are described in the table below.
3. What Cookies Do We Use? 
 Below we list the different types of cookies that may be used on the Sites. To the extent any Personal Information is collected through cookies, the Privacy Notice [https://legal.marketo.com/privacy/] applies and compliments this Cookies Policy. Marketo uses Google Tag Manager to manage its cookies.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.  These cookies enable you to navigate the Sites and to use their services and features. These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

4.  Web Beacons
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.  We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").  These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Sites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.  In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
5. Social Media Features
Our Sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook ‘like’ button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on our Sites to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.
6. Flash Cookies or Local Shared Objects
Our Sites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.
If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Adobe site), how to prevent Flash Cookies from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). 
Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.
7.  Targeted Online and Mobile Advertising
Marketo has engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyze both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Sites. Third party service providers may also serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Sites and provide other personalization services in accordance with this Cookie Policy. These companies may collect and use information about your visits to our Sites and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that may interest you. They may also employ technology that is used to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by the use of cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Sites and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you unless you choose to provide these. 
8.  How Do I Manage Cookies?
In addition to the options provided above, you have the right to refuse or accept cookies from the Sites at any time by activating settings on your browser.  Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen.  You may wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html for information on commonly used browsers.  Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Sites may operate as intended.
You can adjust your cookie preferences by adjusting your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether.  The Help function within your browser should explain how to do this.  Alternatively, you may visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org to obtain detailed information on how to prevent cookies from being set on your particular browser.
 If you want to clear all cookies left behind by the websites you have visited, here are links where you can download three programs that clean out tracking cookies:
o   http://www.lavasoftusa.com/products/ad-aware_se_personal.php, 
o   http://www.spybot.info/en/download/index.html, and
