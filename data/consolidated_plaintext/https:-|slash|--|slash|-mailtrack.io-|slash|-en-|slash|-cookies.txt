                                        third-party cookies.. First-party cookies are those sent to
                                    the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain managed by the Web publisher
                                    itself, from which the service requested by the user is provided. Third-party
                                        cookies are those that are sent to the user’s terminal computer from a
                                    computer or domain that is not managed by the Web publisher, but by another entity
                                    that processes the data obtained through cookies.

                                    information so that the user can access the service with certain characteristics
                                    that can differentiate his or her experience from that of other users, for example
                                    the language; analysis or measurement that allows the person
                                    responsible for them to monitor and analyse the behaviour of the users of the
                                    websites to which they are linked, including the quantification of the impacts of
                                    the advertisements; or, behavioral advertising, which store
                                    information about the behavior of the users obtained through the continuous

                                    the user accesses a website. Persistent cookies are a type of

Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor minimizes an On-site Survey widget. It is

Hotjar cookie that is set when a visitor minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback.

_hjid
Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar
                                    script. It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the
                                    browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be
                                    attributed to the same user ID.

_hjRecordingLastActivity
This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies). This gets updated
                                    when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the
                                    visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).

Third-party cookies


_hjTLDTest
When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we
                                    should use, instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared
                                    across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the
                                    _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After
                                    this check, the cookie is removed.

                                    user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.

This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage. If

                                    has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost immediately after it is created.
