Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies 

Last Updated Date: April 17, 2020.
What are Cookies? Cookies are text files that contain a certain amount of information and are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are useful because they allow websites to recognize a user’s device. They are then returned to the original website on each subsequent visit or to any other website that recognizes them. For more information on cookies, go to http://www.allaboutcookies.org. The term “Cookie” is used in this Notice in the broad sense to include all similar techniques and technology, including web beacons and log files. For more information on these additional tools, see our glossary below.
Types of Information We Collect. Cookies help us to understand Website usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Services and in other media. Examples of the types of information that we collect through Cookies include: The number of users visiting Services, the number of times a Website was viewed, the pages viewed, the clicks made on the Services and the total duration of navigation on the Services; The name of the page that referred you to the Website; Whether this is your first time visiting the Website; Your viewing preferences (e.g. layout, sizing preferences, language etc.); Your user name, your password, the type of browser used and your IP address, so that we can identify you during your next visits.
How We Use Cookies. Examples of ways that we use Cookies include:

To control the display of ads;
To track usage patterns on the Services;
To deliver editorial content;
To record requests for subscriptions;
To implement our affiliate marketing program; and
To personalize information.

PMC (or third party service providers on our behalf) may also use cookies to collect aggregate information about Website users on an anonymous basis (“Anonymous Information”). We may share demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose.
Types of Cookies We Use on Our Services. We use first party and third party Cookies for several reasons. Some Cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Site to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” Cookies. Other Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users and to enhance the experience on our Services. Third parties also serve Cookies through our Services for advertising, analytics and other purposes. The specific types of first and third party Cookies served through our Services and the functions they perform are described in more detail below.

First-party Cookies. These cookies are created by PMC. They allow you to browse our Services and use their features.
Essential Cookies.These cookies are strictly necessary to allow you to move around the Services and use their features, such as accessing your subscriptions. Without these cookies, we cannot enable appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. Therefore, these cookies cannot be disabled.
Functional Cookies.These cookies allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in). To refuse these Cookies, please follow the instructions below under the section Cookie Management. Note that by disabling functional cookies, you may not be able to use some of our features or those features may not function properly.
Embedded Scripts.An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Analytics Cookies.We use Cookies and other identifiers (such as web beacons) to see how you use our Services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, cookies and web beacons may be used to maintain a consistent look and feel across our Services, track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our Services, track errors, and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. To refuse these Cookies, please follow the instructions below under the section Cookie Management.
Cross-Device Cookies.PMC may use cookies in combination with the information we collect — for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers — to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones or tablets), or work with service providers that do this, in order to save your preferences across devices and analyze usage of the Services. To refuse these Cookies, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Third-Party Cookies. Some of our third party partners (including advertisers and marketing services companies) may set and access Cookies on your computer as well, or we may do so on their behalf. We do not have control over how these third parties use such cookies and similar technologies or the information derived therefrom, and this Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information. To see a list of our third party partners, please click here. These types of cookies include:

Advertising Cookies. These Cookies, defined exclusively by third parties, collect several types of data about your browsing habits, as well as your preferences for products and services. This information allows PMC to serve you relevant advertisements on our Services. To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the section Cookie Management. Some advertisements may also contain an icon that you may click on to find out more about how to manage your advertising preferences.
Third-Party Functional Cookies. These Cookies are defined by third parties who support our Services and allow you to use useful services and features. To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the section Cookie Management.


Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your Personally Identifiable Information. To refuse Web Beacons, please follow the instructions below under the section Cookie Management.
HTML. HTML, the language some websites are coded in, may be used to store information on your computer or device about your interaction with and use of the Services. This information may be retrieved by us to help us manage our Services, such as by giving us information about how our Services are being used by our visitors, how they can be improved, and to customize them for our users.

Types of Cookies We Serve on Third-Party Services.
Duration of Storage of Cookies on Your Device. We use both “session cookies” (which expire once you close your web browser) and “persistent cookies” (which stay on your computer until you delete them).
Cookie Management.

Analytics. To learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs for the Web, please visit https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en.
Disabling Advertising Cookies. Some of the advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages after you opt-out, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of the Services and/or third party websites. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept these cookies, you can go to www.networkadvertising.org. If you would like to learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising and to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to www.aboutads.info. The collection of information via certain ads served to users in Canada may be managed by visiting youradchoices.ca. Please note that the-opt out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt-out is applied.
Using Browser Settings. You can disable and/or delete most types of cookies by using your browser settings. Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to access parts of our or others’ Services. The following links provide information on how to modify the cookies settings on some popular browsers:

Apple Safari
Google Chrome
Microsoft Internet Explorer
Mozilla Firefox


Do Not Track Signals. PMC does not act on “do not track” requests from your browser because, this way, we are able to personalize your experiences on our Services. For more information, go to www.networkadvertising.org or www.aboutads.info. If you have questions about the use of Cookies on our Services, please contact us as described in the Contact Us section of our Privacy Policy.
