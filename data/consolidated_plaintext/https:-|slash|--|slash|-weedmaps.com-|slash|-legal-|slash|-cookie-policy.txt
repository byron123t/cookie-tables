4. “Do Not Track” Requests
Weedmaps may track its users over time as they browse third-party sites in order to provide intelligent, customized advertising, and Weedmaps currently does not recognize Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals from web browsers, as the Internet industry is still working on DNT standards and solutions.
In addition, some third parties may collect your information when they serve you content on our Websites. This enables them to tailor what they present to you over time. Many web browsers allow you to set the DNT signal so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. Please review your web browser’s internet options for more details.
