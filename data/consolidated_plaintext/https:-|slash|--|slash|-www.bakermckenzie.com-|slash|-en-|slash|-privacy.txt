Use of Personal Data
The purposes for which we use Personal Data, and the legal bases for such processing, are as follows: 

To provide legal advice and respond to inquiries we use basic data, registration data, client service data, and device data.  We need to process your information in this way in order to perform our obligations under our contracts with our clients. 
To manage our business operations and administer our client relationships we use basic data, special categories of data, registration data, marketing data and client service data.  This processing is necessary in order to perform our obligations under our contracts with our clients (e.g. issuing and processing invoices) and suppliers (e.g. managing the supply of goods and services to the Firm). 
To make our Sites more intuitive and easy to use we use device data.  It is necessary for our legitimate interests to monitor how our Sites are used to help us improve the layout and information available on our Sites and provide a better service to our Site users.
To protect the security and effective functioning of our Sites and information technology systems we use basic data, registration data, transaction data, and device data.  It is necessary for our legitimate interests to monitor how our Sites are used to detect and prevent fraud, other crimes and the misuse of our Sites. This helps us to ensure that you can safely use our Sites.
To provide relevant marketing  such as providing you with information about events or services that may be of interest to you including legal services, legal updates, client conferences or networking events, and groups of specific interest (e.g. specific types of networking groups) we use marketing data, basic data, special categories of data, registration data, client service data, and device data. It is necessary for our legitimate interests to process this information in order to provide you with tailored and relevant marketing, updates and invitations.
To address compliance and legal obligations, such as complying with the Firm's tax reporting obligations, checking the identity of new clients and to prevent money laundering and/or fraud we use compliance data, basic data, registration data, transaction data, and device data. This processing is necessary for the purposes of complying with legal requirements to which we are subject.
To consider individuals for employment and contractor opportunities and manage on-boarding procedures we use job applicant data and compliance data. The processing is necessary for the purposes of recruitment and on-boarding and for complying with legal obligations to which we are subject and which may be subject to a relevant local recruitment privacy policy.

Performance Cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
Targeting Cookies: These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
Social Media Cookies: These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.

 


What are your options if you do not want cookies on your computer?
When you first visit our Sites, you will be asked for your consent to the use of any cookies which are not classed as strictly necessary. You can manage your choices using the consent management tool provided. If you change your mind, you can adjust your preferences at any time using the manage cookies link in the footer of our Sites. 

Data Subject Rights
If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) you have the following rights: 

Access. Subject to certain exceptions , you have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data we are processing about you, which we will provide to you in electronic form. At our discretion we may require you to prove your identity before providing the requested information.  If you require multiple copies of your Personal Data, we may charge a reasonable administration fee. 
Rectification. You have the right to require that any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Data that we process about you is amended. 
Deletion. You have the right to request that we delete Personal Data that we process about you, unless we are required to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. 
Restriction. You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your Personal Data where:
    
you believe such data to be inaccurate; 
our processing is unlawful; or 
we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose, but where we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not want us to delete it.  


Portability. You have the right to request that we transmit the Personal Data we hold in respect of you to another data controller, where this is:
    
personal information which you have provided to us; and 
we are processing that data on the basis of your consent or in order to perform our obligations under contract to you (such as to provide legal services). 


Objection. Where the legal justification for our processing of your Personal Data is our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your particular situation.  We will abide by your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or if we need to continue to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.
Withdrawing Consent.  If you have consented to our processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, free of charge  This includes cases where you wish to opt out from marketing messages that you receive from us. 

If you are in the EEA you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local data protection authority if you believe that we have not complied with applicable data protection laws. Access a list of local data protection authorities in EEA countries.

Data Security
We have implemented technical and organisational measures in an effort to safeguard the Personal Data in our custody and control. Such measures include:

restricting access to Personal Data to staff and service providers on a need-to-know basis;
a formal Information Security Management System (ISMS) aligned with ISO 27001 and 27002:2013.  The ISMS is a comprehensive set of policies and procedures for deploying, managing and securing the Firm's Information Technology infrastructure; utilizing a defense-in-depth approach to protecting our internal Firm and client data.  

While we endeavour to always protect our systems, sites, operations and information against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle and other risk factors, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission or while stored on our systems, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
You also have an important role in protecting Personal Data. You should not share any username, password or other authentication data provided to you with anyone, and we recommend that you do not re-use passwords across more than one website or application.  If you have any reason to believe that your username or password has been compromised, please contact us as detailed below.

Cross-Border Data Transfers
We transfer Personal Data to jurisdictions as necessary for the purposes described above, including to jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country.  In particular, our Sites are hosted on servers in the United States. If you are located in a non-US jurisdiction, the transfer of Personal Data is necessary to provide you with the requested information and/or to perform any requested transaction. When you submit personal information to us you are transferring your data across borders. 
With respect to transfers originating from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to the United States and other non-EEA jurisdictions, we implement standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, and other appropriate solutions to address cross-border transfers as required or permitted by Articles 46 and 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation.  Where required by such laws, you may request a copy of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us as detailed below.
