Our cookie policy
This cookie policy relates to the following websites: bt.com, home.bt.com, player.bt.com,
          community.bt.com and appointment.bt.com
        




Edit your cookie settings


You can change your cookie settings for the bt.com website through the
          Manage Cookie Settings page at any time.
        




What are cookies and why do we use them?



          Cookies and similar technologies (“cookies”) allow small pieces
          of information to be read from and/or placed onto your device when you visit a
          website or application. This allows for websites and applications to recognise you
          or your device on each subsequent visit so that they can remember things like preferences,
          log in information and saved shopping carts.
        

          Cookies are very useful and do lots of different jobs. For example, they enable you to move between our web
          pages efficiently, remember your preferences when you visit us again and generally improve your experience
          when browsing with us. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and
          your interests, which in turn help us to tailor our communications.
        

          Cookies last for different lengths of time depending on the job they do. There are session cookies and
          persistent cookies:
        

Session cookies only last for your online session and disappear from your device when you close your
            browser.
Persistent cookies stay on your device after the browser has been closed and last for the period of time
            specified in the cookie.

You can find information about how BT processes your personal data in our privacy policy which can be found
          at bt.com/privacy-policy




Your choices



          We will only place cookies for the preference level you set. Your preference level will be set depending on
          the options chosen (usually when you first visit our website), however these can be changed at any time by
          clicking "Manage Cookie Settings" at the top of this page.
        

          Please note that cookies set before you changed your settings will still be on your device. You can remove
          them using your browser settings.
        

          Our free online tool can help you manage the cookies we use on bt.com. To use it, your web browser needs to
          support JavaScript – if it doesn't you can still find out about the cookies we use here, but you'll need to
          manage them through your web browser settings.
        

          We also use a cookie to remember your cookie preferences. This means:
        

If you delete all your cookies you will have to update your preferences with us again – we’ll ask you when
            you next visit our website
If you use a different device, computer profile or browser you will have to tell us your preferences
            again.
          

Please note that we may share the information we obtain from cookies with other members of the BT Group. All
          members of the BT Group provide the same high level of security and protection and will only use information
          obtained from cookies in accordance with the preferences you set.

4. Targeting



          The core purpose of targeting cookies (otherwise known as advertising cookies) is to provide BT with valuable
          insights into what our customers want, including but not limited to, insight into the communications and
          services our customers and potential customers may be interested in.
        
Disabling targeting cookies, generally does not stop you receiving advertising. It simply means that the
          advertising you receive is less likely to be aligned with your interests. 
In order to gain the insights, in some instances we may analyse your personal information to create a profile
          of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information relevant to you. This helps to
          avoid you receiving advertising that is not relevant to you or your interests. 
In some instances, we may also use this information to inform us of how well our communications are received
          by our customers and website users. In order to do this, we may make use of additional information about you
          when it is available from internal and external sources to help us do this effectively.
These cookies are also linked to services provided to BT and our customers by our trusted partners (see the
          Third Parties section below for more information). We/our trusted partners may also share data derived from
          these cookies with other members of the BT Group for the purpose and provision of the services they provide.
        

We use Targeting cookies to: 


Link to social networks who may use information about your visit to target advertising to you on other
            websites;
Provide advertising agencies, our trusted partners and other members of the BT Group with information on
            your visit so that we can present adverts that you may be interested in, and prevent you receiving duplicate
            ads – see the “Online behavioural advertising”  section below for further details;
          
Deliver content, including video content, tailored to your interests;
Help us to segment and understand our audience by providing additional information so that we can send the
            most relevant communications possible;
Help us identify customers similar to our audience or to serve relevant adverts to you on third party
            websites and apps;
Help us to understand how well our marketing initiatives are performing and whether to continue, change or
            cease those initiatives; and
To provide tailored communications to you and personalise your use of our website when logged in,
            and in limited circumstances, when logged out (subject to your preferences).
          


Online behavioural advertising
We, and our trusted partners (see “Third parties” section below) use information collected from targeting
            cookies to collect information about your device and identify your interests by understanding how you
            interact
            with our websites, communications and services. We do this so we can tailor advertising we show you on our
            own
            and third party sites and apps.
The information we and our trusted partners collect and share through targeting cookies does not
            directly
            identify you. It does not include your name or address. 
We use your IP address, together with the interests we have assumed based onhow you’ve navigated to and interacted with our websites. For example, if you look at our TV and film packages, we will assume you would like to hear about the latest TV and film offerings we, or our partners, have to offer. 
We will also share interest-based advertising information with the third parties that set targeting cookies via our website.
You can opt-out of the use of targeting cookies on our website for online behavioural advertising purposes by blocking and/or deleting these cookies as described below.

Third parties 



          BT allow trusted third party partners to set cookies when you interact with BT services. Third parties include
          search engines, providers of measurement and analytics services, social media networks, affiliate networks,
          other members of the BT Group and advertising companies. Third parties may use cookies in the process of
          delivering content, including ads relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their marketing
          and services, and to perform services on behalf of BT (as described in the cookie categories above).
        
Third parties may also read cookies placed on your device when visiting other websites, which usually takes
          place where that third party also sets cookies on other websites you have visited. You can manage browser
          cookies through your browser settings (see the Managing Cookies section below).
It is important to note that, although BT and its trusted third party partners will only set cookies in line
          with your preferences, if you originally accept the use of cookies, but later change your settings, BT and its
          trusted third party partners may continue to use data collected and derived from cookies during the period of
          time you consented to the cookie placement. 




Managing cookies

This method will not impact any cookies previously set, prior to your change in preferences. If you wish to
          manage existing cookies, you can use your browser settings as outlined below.
