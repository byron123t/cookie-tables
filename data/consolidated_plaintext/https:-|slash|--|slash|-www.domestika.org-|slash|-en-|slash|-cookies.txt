Farewell Carlos Pacheco, illustrator and superhero

Remembering the life and work of Spanish comic artist, teacher, and legend of the Marvel and DC comics.


Domestika is deeply saddened by the passing of Carlos Pacheco, Spanish illustrator, teacher, true superhero of the comic genre, and member of this creative community. In September he announced his ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) diagnosis on social media and has died from the degenerative disease aged 60 at the Línea de la Concepción hospital in Cádiz.
