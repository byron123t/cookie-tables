    Data protection and privacy notice  

The European Patent Office ("EPO") is committed to ensuring respect for the fundamental rights of natural persons ("data subjects") to privacy and to the protection of their personal data processed by it when performing its tasks and providing its services.


Legal framework for the protection of personal data
at the EPO


The EPO is an international
organisation established by the European Patent Convention (EPC) and, as such,
is not subject to EU Regulation 2016/679 - General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR). On 30 June 2021, the EPO adopted a new data protection framework which
is in line with best practices at European and international level. The Data
Protection Rules (DPR) are the core of this new framework.


All personal data collected or
managed by the EPO are processed in accordance with the Data Protection Rules,
which aim at ensuring that the EPO's handling of data subjects' information
meets the highest standards of protection. Processing operations carried out by
the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation do not fall
under these Rules. Additionally, Articles 49 to 52 DPR do not apply to the
processing of personal data by the EPO Boards of Appeal in their judicial
capacity.


The decision
of the President of the European Patent Office (‘the President') dated 13
December 2021 concerning the processing of personal data in patent-grant and
related proceedings, complements the DPR. 


For the
processing of personal data by the EPO, the President acts as controller. The
President is free to delegate the controllership to EPO operational units
(Article 28(3) DPR), which then act as delegated controllers. For additional
information on the delegated controllers, please refer to the decision of the President of the European
Patent Office identifying the operational units of the
Office acting as delegated controllers dated 17 May 2022.


For the processing of personal data by the EPO Boards of
Appeal in their judicial capacity, the President of the Boards of Appeal acts
as controller. With regard to the personal data processing operations carried
out by the Boards of Appeal in the exercise of administrative functions and
powers delegated to the President of the Boards of Appeal under the Act
of Delegation, the President of the
Boards of Appeal acts as controller and the deputy of the President of the
Boards of Appeal acts as delegated controller. For additional information,
please refer to the decision
of the President of the Board of Appeal of
5 April 2022 appointing a delegated controller within the meaning of the Data
Protection Rules. For all other processing activities carried out by the Boards
of Appeal Unit, the President of the Boards of Appeal acts as delegated
controller of the President of the EPO.


Article 32 DPR requires the EPO
to keep a central register
with records of its processing activities. Entries to this register will be
progressively introduced within six months of the entry into force of the DPR.
Records describing the processing of personal data of external data subjects
are publicly accessible on the EPO website. External data subjects can consult
these records to learn more about how the EPO processes their personal data.


The EPO's Data Protection Officer
independently monitors the internal application of and compliance with the Data
Protection Rules with respect to all processing operations carried out by the
EPO. A Data Protection Board appointed by the President is mandated with an
oversight and advisory function and has a role in the legal redress mechanism
(Article 47 DPR).

	EPO Data Protection Rules 


Data protection and privacy policy

This data protection and privacy policy ("policy")
explains how personal data collected by the EPO is processed.


a. What
information do we process? 


Personal data means any information relating to any identified or
identifiable natural person (also referred to as "data subject" or "individual");
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more
factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
economic, cultural or social identity; personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation
but could still be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional
information are to be considered to be information relating to an identifiable
natural person.


We classify
personal data in two categories:


Mandatory personal data: this means the personal data necessary for (1) the
	performance of a task carried out in the exercise of the official activities of
	the European Patent Organisation or in the legitimate exercise of the official
	authority vested in the EPO, which includes the processing necessary for the EPO's
	management and functioning, (2) compliance with a legal obligation to which the
	EPO is subject and (3) the performance of a contract to which the data subject
	is party.
	

		Examples
		include the personal data the EPO collects to fulfil its obligation to maintain
		a public patent register (see Rule 143 EPC and the related decision of the President) and the personal data it collects
		for login authentication and security purposes.
		


Non-mandatory personal data: this means personal data collected and processed on the
	basis of the data subject's consent. The specific rules on collecting consent are
	in Article 7 DPR.
	

		Examples
		include the personal data about dietary or mobility requirements that data subjects may provide
		when registering for an event and the contact data of professional
		representatives accessible via a searchable database on the EPO website.   
		




For more information on the
categories of personal data processed during patent-grant and related
proceedings, see the decision
of the President dated 13 December 2021 concerning the processing of
personal data in patent-grant and related proceedings.


Personal data collected by the
EPO are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
purpose(s) for which they are processed.


b. What
do we use your personal data for?


"Processing" of personal data means any
operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets
of personal data, such as collection, storage, use, disclosure or erasure.


When you interact with the EPO, your personal data are
collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purpose(s) and not further
processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which they
were collected. 


Our processing of personal data must follow a number of
principles. These include that the processing must be lawful, fair and
transparent to the data subject and ensure appropriate security of the personal
data.


The purposes for which personal data are processed are set
out in the relevant data protection statements and records made available to
data subjects.


c. What
is the legal basis for processing your personal data?


The EPO's processing operations are based on Article 5 DPR,
which provides that we can collect personal data:



	for the performance of a task carried
	out in the exercise of the official activities of the European Patent Organisation
	or in the legitimate exercise of the official authority vested in the
	controller, which includes the processing necessary for the EPO's management
	and functioning
	

	for compliance with a legal
	obligation to which the controller is subject
	
for the performance of a contract to
	which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the
	data subject prior to entering into a contract
	

	when the data subject has given
	explicit consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more
	specific purposes
	

	to protect the vital interests of the
	data subject or of another natural person
	


d. Who
has access to your personal data and to whom is it disclosed?


Except where published in the
European Patent Register (under
Article 127 and Rule 143 EPC and the related decision of the President), your personal data are not made available to the public unless you have
given your express consent.


Personal data may be accessed,
disseminated and processed only on a strict need-to-know basis, by the authorised
EPO staff and third-party service providers. Personal data are not disclosed to
any other recipients. For more information on how we protect and safeguard your
personal data, see point e. below.


e. How
do we protect and safeguard your personal data?


We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to
safeguard and protect personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction,
loss, alteration and unauthorised disclosure or access.


All personal data processed on systems hosted on the EPO
premises are stored in secure IT applications in accordance with the security
standards of EPO, which include the following measures:



	User
	authentication: all workstations and servers require log-in, mobile devices
	require log-in to the EPO enclave, privileged accounts require additional and
	stronger authentication
	

	Access
	control (e.g. role-based access control to the systems and network, principles
	of need-to-know and least privilege): separation into administrator and user
	roles, users have minimum privileges, overall administrator roles are kept to
	a minimum
	

	Logical
	security hardening of systems, equipment and network: 802.1x for network
	access, encryption of endpoint devices, antivirus on all devices
	

	Physical
	protection: EPO access controls, additional access controls to datacentre,
	policies on locking offices
	

	Transmission
	and input controls (e.g. audit logging, systems and network monitoring):
	security monitoring with Splunk
	

	Security
	incident response: 24/7 monitoring for incidents, on-call security expert.
	


For personal data processed on
systems not hosted on the EPO premises, the providers processing the personal
data have committed in a binding agreement to comply with their data protection
obligations stemming from the applicable data protection legal frameworks. The
EPO has also carried out a privacy and security risk assessment. These systems
are required to have implemented appropriate technical and organisational
measures such as: physical security measures, access and storage control
measures, securing data at rest (e.g. by encryption); user, transmission and
input control measures (e.g. network firewalls, network intrusion detection
system (IDS), network intrusion protection system (IPS), audit logging);
conveyance control measures (e.g. securing data in transit by encryption).


f. How
long do we keep your personal data?


Personal data kept in a form which permits identification of
data subjects will be stored only for the time needed to achieve the purposes
for which it is processed.


In the case of personal data processed pursuant to Rule 143 EPC and the related decision of the President, the EPO is legally obliged to keep
them indefinitely. Otherwise, specific retention periods are established for
each specific processing of personal data. 


For more information, data subjects may refer to the specific
data protection statement or data protection record.


g. Social
network features


The EPO uses social media to communicate its work and better
engage with the public. We are on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Xing and YouTube
and we encourage all individuals to share our content and take part in our
discussions!


Our website uses social plug-ins of Facebook, Twitter,
LinkedIn, Xing and YouTube ("social media providers"). If you are
logged into your social network account with one of those social media
providers when you visit the website, the social media provider might assign your
visit to their network account. If you use the functions of the social
plug-ins, this information will also be transmitted directly from your browser
to the social media provider and may be stored there. 


Each social media provider has its own policy on how it processes
your personal data when you access its website. We therefore encourage you to
refer to the various providers' privacy policies for more information on the
purposes and scope of their processing of the personal data:


Facebook
Twitter

LinkedIn

Xing

YouTube



h. Changes
to this policy


The EPO has always aimed to keep our data protection
framework in line with the latest developments and best practices, and we will also
update this policy accordingly. We therefore encourage you to consult it
regularly.

What are your rights and how can you exercise them? 
Can
your rights be restricted? 
What redress mechanisms are available? 
a. Your
data protection rights


As a data subject, you have the following rights under the
EPO Data Protection Rules:






Data subjects' rights




Description






Right to information (Articles 16 and 17 DPR)




			Where personal data has not been obtained from the data
			subjects, the controller shall, at the time when personal data is obtained,
			provide data subjects with information on the categories of personal data
			concerned and the source of the personal data and, if applicable, whether it
			came from publicly accessible sources.
			





Right of access
			(Article 18 DPR)




			Data subjects have the
			right to request confirmation as to whether or not their personal data is
			being processed, and, if so, to access the personal data easily and at
			reasonable intervals, to understand which data about them is processed, to
			verify the quality of their personal data, to verify the lawfulness of the
			processing and to exercise their other rights.
			





Right to rectification (Article 19 DPR)




			Data subjects have the right to request the correction of
			inaccurate personal data concerning them.
			





Right to erasure
			(Article 20 DPR)




			Data subjects have the
			right to request the erasure of their personal data under certain
			circumstances, e.g. if their personal data is no longer necessary for the
			purposes for which it was collected or if their personal data has been
			unlawfully processed.






Right to restriction of processing (Article 21 DPR)




			Data subjects have the right to obtain from the EPO the
			restriction of processing of their personal data if the data is inaccurate,
			the EPO no longer needs it for the purposes of processing or the processing
			is unlawful, or, where they have already objected to processing, pending
			verification of their objection.
			





Right to data
			portability (Article 22 DPR)




			When personal data is
			processed on the basis of Articles 5(c), 5(d) and 11(2)(a) DPR, data subjects
			have the right to receive, in a structured, commonly used and
			machine-readable format, the personal data concerning them which they have
			provided to the controller and the right to transmit those data to another
			controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data
			were initially provided.
			





Right to object (Article 23 DPR) 




			Data subjects have the right to object, at any time, to the
			processing of their personal data under certain circumstances. The controller
			shall cease to process the personal data unless it demonstrates compelling
			legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights
			and freedoms of the data subjects.
			





Right to not be
			subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (Article 24
			DPR)




			Decisions based solely
			on automated processing are decisions made by machines, including profiling,
			which produce legal effects concerning or similarly significantly affecting data
			subjects. Data subjects have the right not to be subject to this kind of
			decision, except where the decision is necessary for entering into, or
			performance of a contract between them and the EPO, is authorised by a legal
			act or is based on their explicit consent.
			





b. Can
your rights be restricted?


Data protection is not an absolute right. It always has to be
balanced against other fundamental rights and so there may be circumstances
where one or more of your rights may be restricted. If they are restricted, you
will be informed of the main reasons for this and of your right to ask the Data
Protection Officer to investigate and/or file a request for review with the
delegated controller (see the procedure described below in d.).


These rights might be restricted on the legitimate grounds
established by Article 25 of the EPO Data Protection Rules and the Circular No. 420 implementing Article 25 DPR
when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and
freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society
to safeguard:



	the
	European Patent Organisation's security, public security or defence of the contracting
	states

	the
	prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or
	the enforcement of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and
	the prevention of threats to public security and including cases in which
	Article 20 of the Protocol of Privileges and Immunities is applied

c. How to exercise your rights


If you would like to exercise your
rights as a data subject, you can contact the delegated controller via email at
DPOexternalusers@epo.org. 


The delegated controller should
respond without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of
your request. This period may be extended by two further months where necessary
in view of the complexity and number of the requests. In this case, the delegated
controller must duly notify you of the extension and the reasons for the delay
within one month of the EPO's receipt of the request.


When contacting the EPO to exercise your
right(s), in order to enable us to respond more promptly and precisely to your
request, you always need to provide certain preliminary information with the
request. Therefore, we encourage you to fill in this form and submit it with your request.


d. What redress mechanisms are available?


If you consider that the EPO's
processing of your personal data infringes your rights as a data subject, you
can make use of the specific means of redress available to you under the DPR.
Please note that access to these redress mechanisms is conditional on respecting
the order of the steps described below.

Overview

The overview of the redress
mechanisms below is intended as a user-friendly illustration, but its content
is not legally binding. The Data
Protection Rules and the Rules
of Procedure of the Data Protection Board are the applicable and binding
legal provisions.




First step

Data subjects who consider that
the processing of their personal data by the Office infringes the
above-mentioned rights may request the
delegated controller to review the matter and take a decision (Article 49
DPR). Where the processing is carried out by the EPO
Boards of Appeal in the exercise of functions and powers under the Act
of Delegation, please address your request for review to the President of
the Boards of Appeal, who acts as controller of these activities.


Timeframe: You must submit your request for
	review no later than three months from the day on which you were informed or
	otherwise became aware of the processing of personal data allegedly infringing
	your rights.
How to file a request for review by the delegated
	controller? Data subjects should send their request by filling in the request
	for review form and sending it to: DPOexternalusers@epo.org. 
Procedure:
	
The delegated controller should respond without
		undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of your request.
This period may be extended by two further
		months where necessary, in view of the complexity and number of the requests.
		If so, the controller must duly notify the data subject of the extension and
		the reasons for the delay within one month of the EPO's receipt of the request.
If the controller or the delegated controller
		fails to take any action by the end of a period of three months, this will be
		deemed to be an implicit rejection of your request.



Second step

If you are not satisfied with the
delegated controller's decision or if the delegated controller fails to take
action within three months of submission of your request, you can file a
complaint with the Data Protection Board under Article 50 DPR. The Data Protection
Board will handle your complaint in accordance with its Rules
of Procedure.


Timeframe: You must file your complaint with the
	Data Protection Board within three months of receipt of the delegated
	controller's decision or, in the case of an implicit rejection, of the date of
	expiry of the time limit for replying to your request for review.
How to lodge a complaint with the Data
	Protection Board: By filling in the
	request form and sending it to dpbcomplaints@epo.org.
	
Procedure:
	
The Data Protection Board invites the parties to
		set out in writing their position on the claims and facts at issue and to provide
		evidence or comments and arguments on evidence already at hand.
Further, the Data Protection Board issues a
		reasoned opinion to the controller. If it is deemed necessary, it may recommend
		compensation for material and/or non-material damage.
Once the opinion is communicated, the controller
		takes a final decision. If the controller does not follow the Data Protection
		Board's opinion, it must set out the reasons in writing.
The controller notifies the parties, as well as
		the Data Protection Officer and the Data Protection Board, of the final
		decision and the conclusions of the Data Protection Board.



Third and last step

If you disagree with the
controller's final decision on your complaint, you can ask the President of the
Office for ad-hoc arbitration proceedings to resolve the dispute (Article 52
DPR).


Timeframe: You must submit your request for
	arbitration within three months of receiving the controller's final decision.
Contact: You must fill in the
	request form and send it, together with all the necessary documentation
	it asks you to provide, to the President of the EPO at president@epo.org. 
Procedure:
	
Arbitration takes place in The Hague (the
		Netherlands), with a qualified arbitrator appointed by the Secretary General of
		the Permanent Court of Arbitration.
The law governing the arbitration is the EPC,
		the EPO Data Protection Rules, including any implementing legislation, the law
		of international organisations and the principles of public international law.
The arbitration is confidential, and the result
		will be consolidated in the form of a written settlement (also called
		"arbitration award") which also fixes the costs of arbitration.
The European Patent Organisation pays the
		arbitration fees, but each party pays his or her own costs of legal
		representation and expenses unless the arbitrator decides otherwise.
