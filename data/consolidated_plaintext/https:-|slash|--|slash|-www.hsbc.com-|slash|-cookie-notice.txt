How we remember your cookie preferences
Your preferences are stored in cookies stored on your browser. If you switch off a category of cookies that you’ve previously accepted, then for technical reasons those cookies will not be deleted. 
To delete cookies from your browser, we recommend that you clear your browser data. If you do this, or change browser, we’ll ask for your preferences again when you next visit our website.

Cookie duration and your browser settings
The length of time for which cookies are stored on your browser varies depending on the cookie. Some cookies only last for your online session, whereas others will stay on your browser for a reasonable time afterwards. Unless we’ve given a specific time in the list of cookies above, the cookies set via our website will usually last between 13 and 24 months from your most recent visit to our site. 
Some of our partners in the list above also use the same cookies to collect information about the use of their own or other websites. In these cases the cookie can remain on your device, usually for up to 24 months from your last visit to the site that accessed that cookie.

You can use your browser settings to delete cookies that have already been set at any time. You can also use your browser settings to manage cookies, for example, to switch off a cookie altogether. If you do this, it could mean that we can't use strictly necessary cookies properly and so parts of our website may not work correctly. For more information about how to use your browser settings to clear your browser data or to manage cookies, check your browser 'Help' function.
Our websites
We’re changing the way we set cookies on the websites we manage. This means that some of our websites may ask you to accept cookies again, or they may not yet be able to fully respect your preferences. We’re working on this. Please contact us if you have any questions.
Cookies and your privacy
The information cookies collect, and how we use that information, may count as personal data. We may also be able to identify you by name, IP address or session ID. You have rights regarding how we collect, store and use your personal data. 
You can learn more about how we use your personal data in our Privacy notice.
