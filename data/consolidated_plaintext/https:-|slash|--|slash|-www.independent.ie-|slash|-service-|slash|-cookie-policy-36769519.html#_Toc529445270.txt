About this Cookie Policy
As Ireland’s largest media company, INM reaches millions of people each week across print and online. INM is a group of companies that has a number of online sites and services including Independent.ie and BelfastTelegraph.co.uk. Information about the companies in our group can be found here.
This Cookie Policy applies to:

https://www.independent.ie 

and all associated subdomains such as elections.independent.ie. It also covers all the regional publication sites such as The Argus which are listed at: 

https://www.independent.ie/regionals/

Other sites in the INM group such as BelfastTelegraph.co.uk have their own cookie policy.
This Cookie Policy explains what cookies and trackers are and how we use them. You should read this policy so you can understand what type of cookies and trackers that we use, the information we collect using cookies and how that information is used. You can also manage your settings for these cookies and trackers. For further information on how we use, store and keep your personal data secure, see our Privacy Policy.
INM uses cookies and trackers to help us remember details of your visits to our websites and our apps. This includes, but not limited to technical information about your visit e.g. traffic data, location data, browser language, your IP address, the previous website from which you reached us and the type of browser you use. Accordingly, our Privacy Statement will apply to our treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies and trackers.
Please use the tools on this page to control how your data is processed on this website and around the web.
What are cookies and trackers?
A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device (e.g. your phone or your computer) which collects information, potentially including personal information about you. Trackers are the common name for a group of tools which do the same thing for sites and apps.
They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of websites. For example, a cookie could allow the Site to recognise your browser/login details, while another could store your preferences and other information and let you navigate the Site effectively. Cookies can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
Statistical and analytical information from cookies and trackers provides us with general information about the number of people who visit this Site; the number of people who return to this Site; the pages that they visit; where they were immediately before they came to this Site and the page in the Site at which they exited. This information helps us monitor traffic on our Site so that we can manage the Site's capacity and efficiency. It also helps us to understand which parts of this Site are most popular, and generally to assess user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Site.
We may partner with or receive services from third parties which you can visit from our Site. We may also embed external content and features from such third parties within our Site (e.g. social media networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter). We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site.
In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy statements and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

Changes to our Cookie Policy
We can change this Cookie Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Cookie Policy, we will let you know either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Site or by sending you an email.
It is important that you review the changed Cookie Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Cookies Policy, then we cannot continue to provide the Site to you, and your only option is to stop accessing the Site.

Types of Cookies
We may place our cookies and trackers on your device via our website and apps. Our Privacy Statement will apply to how we treat the information we collect through these tools. The following are the main types of cookies used on the Site, links to their privacy statements and tools for controlling them where appropriate.
Essential Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, filling in forms or serving contextual ads. The types of essential cookies used are:

GDPR Consent: A simple cookie to track whether you have reviewed and consented to the latest version of our privacy policies.

We use these cookies to work out which account you are signed in with, and if you are allowed access to a particular service. It also allows us to associate any comments you post with your username. While you are signed into this Site, we combine information from your registration cookies with analytics cookies, which we could use to identify which pages you have seen on our Site.

Analytics Cookies
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.
Every time a user visits our Site, web analytics software provided by a third party generates an anonymous analytics cookie. These cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the Site before. Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies, and if you don't, we generate new ones. This allows us to track how many individual unique users we have, and how often they visit the Site. Unless you are signed in to our Site, these cookies cannot be used to identify individuals; they are used for statistical purposes only. If you are logged in, we will also know the details you gave to us for this, such as username and email address. This allows us to better tailor our site for our registered users.
These analytics tools run on most sites across the web. If you wish to opt out of analytics tracking you must do so on these 3rd party sites or by changing your browser settings. Click on a link below to see the privacy policy and manage your consent across the web for each cookie type:

ChartBeat
Google Analytics
Hotjar
Google Advertising- Audience Pixel)

These cookies typically persist for between one and three years to allow bulk comparisons of traffic from year to year.
Behavioural Advertising Cookies
We facilitate third parties to serve advertisements through our Site. Advertisers try to make these ads relevant to you by tracking the topics you are interested in and other ads that you like to engage with across the web.
Third Parties: These advertising cookies may be set through our site and other sites you visit around the web by third-party advertisers.
They may be used by those third parties to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts here and on other sites across the web. These profiles are based on identifying your IP address, browser or internet device.
INM: We also create anonymous audience segments based on interactions with our Site and apps which can be tied back to a single cookie or device ID. We use cookie technologies provided by Google DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) and Oracle Bluekai Data Management Platform (DMP) to assist us in creating these audience segments. We have no possibility of linking any anonymous user of our Site who may be classified into an audience segment to an individual identifiable person.
Cookies and Trackers used:
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB): Most third party advertisers participate in the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Transparency and Consent Framework, which means that you can, in one place, manage your privacy settings around behavioural advertising. We use the Quantcast Consent Management Platform, a industry standard, IAB approved systems to allow you to manage your own IAB settings.

Manage consent for advertisers participating in the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) privacy framework

The expiry date for the IAB Advertising Framework Cookie is 6 months.
Google DFP: Google DoubleClick for Publishers is our primary ad serving partner and Google provides its own mechanism for controlling how ads are personalised to you.

Manage consent for advertising served through Google

Google anonymize IP addresses in logs by removing part of the address after 9 months. After 18 months, they further anonymize log data by anonymizing or deleting cookie or advertising ID information in both logs and ad serving databases.
User data tied to cookies and advertising IDs is also used to detect and prevent ad fraud and ensure that users don’t see ads that they’ve blocked in the past. In these cases, or in cases where Google stores this data on behalf of its customers (e.g. in Google Analytics), data may be stored for periods longer than those specified above.
Social Media Cookies
We enable these third party cookies on our site to facilitate social sharing of our content.
