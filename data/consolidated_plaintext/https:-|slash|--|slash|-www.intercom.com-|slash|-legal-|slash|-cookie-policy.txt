Introduction
This Cookie Policy explains how Intercom, Inc. and its affiliates, including without limitation Intercom R&D Unlimited Company (collectively "Intercom", "we", "us", and "ours"), use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites, including without limitation www.intercom.com, www.intercom.io, app.intercom.com, app.intercom.io and any related URLs, mobile or localized versions and related domains / sub-domains ("Websites"), and interact with any of Intercom's messenger domains (including widget.intercom.io and api-iam.intercom.io) (the " Messenger"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as the choices for how to control them.
Cookies and similar technologies and the processing of personal data
We may process personal data about you when we use cookies or similar technologies, for example, your IP address, username, unique identifier, or an email address. Where we do so we will only process your personal data in compliance with our Privacy Policy. You can read about how and why we collect your personal data, who we may share your personal data with and how you can exercise your rights under applicable data protection law here.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on the browser on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and use its functions, or use an app. Cookies are widely used by online service providers to facilitate and help to make the interaction with users faster and easier (by helping us to distinguish between you and other users and enabling us to retrieve things like your settings and preferences), as well as to provide reporting information and facilitate online advertising.
Cookies set by Intercom on the Websites and the Messenger are called "first party cookies". Cookies on the Websites set by parties other than Intercom are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Websites (e.g. advertising, interactive content and analytics).
Why do we use cookies?
We use first party and/or third party cookies on our Websites and Messenger for various purposes such as:

to facilitate the operation and functionality of our Websites and the Messenger;
to improve your experience of our Websites and make navigating around them quicker and easier;
to allow us to make a bespoke user experience for you and for us to understand what is useful or of interest to you;
to analyze how our Websites are used and how best we can customize them;
to identify future prospects and personalize marketing and sales interactions with them;
to facilitate the tailoring of online advertising to your interests.

What type of cookies do we use and what are they used for?
We use the following types of cookies in our Websites and/or Messenger:
Essential Cookies
We use essential cookies to make our Websites work. These cookies are strictly necessary to enable core functionality such as security, network management, your cookie preferences and accessibility. Without them you wouldn't be able to use basic services. You may disable these by changing your browser settings, but this may affect how the Websites function.
Performance and functionality cookies
These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your login details every time you visit the Websites as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in previously.
Marketing cookies
These account-based marketing cookies enable us to identify future prospects and personalize sales and marketing interactions with them.
Analytics and customization cookies
These cookies collect information that is used to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Websites for you.
We use cookies served by Google Analytics to collect limited data directly from end-user browsers to enable us to better understand your use of our Websites. Further information on how Google collects and uses this data can be found at: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can opt-out of all Google supported analytics on our Websites by visiting: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
We use Hotjar in order to better understand your use of our Websites, to optimize our Websites and to improve your experience. For further details, please see Hotjar’s privacy policy which can be found here: https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy. You can opt-out of all Hotjar supported analytics and data collection on our Websites by visiting: https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out.
Advertising cookies
These cookies collect information over time about your online activity on the Websites and other online services to make online advertisements more relevant to you. This is known as interest-based advertising. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing and ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers.
Here is a list of the cookies we use on our Website and Messenger and why:

We may use other similar technologies too, like web beacons, tags, pixels, clear gifs, caching and local browser storage.
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). Their function is to provide us with statistical information about site traffic and how people navigate through our site, as well as to facilitate marketing and interest-based advertising. Web beacons are typically transparent graphic images placed on a site. Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to measure the actions of visitors on websites and so declining cookies will impair their functioning. We and our marketing and advertising partners may use web beacons to obtain information such as the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page.
We may also use web beacons in marketing emails sent by our system. If you receive the HTML formatted version of such emails and your email is configured to download images, a record of whether or not you open the email (and, if you open the email, how frequently you open it) will be saved with your subscriber history. Your engagement with the content of the communication (such as which links you click on) will also be recorded.
We also use caching and local storage in your browser to store personalization settings such as your language and which tabs you were last viewing inside our product. This allows us to enhance your experience and resume sessions where you left off.
We may use this information to give us an indication of the popularity of content and to help us make decisions about future content and formatting. We may also use the information to publish more content relevant to users in future issues and to unsubscribe recipients who haven't opened our emails for a period of time.
