Tara J. BranniganHead of Community and Customer ServiceFlare Games

KTplay has played a big role in the success of our community for Zombie Gunship Survival. The integrated nature of the KTplay platform ensures that anyone can participate, substantially increasing the number of players that interact with the community. Within just days of launch we had player guides, tutorial videos, and fan fiction pouring in from the community, all without prompting! 









 Martin KwasnicaCEO & Co-Founder Cherrypick
                                Games

Simply by providing a centralized and focused place (in-game community) to chat and talk,
                            players jumped at the chance to share their gameplay experiences with one another, we also
                            like to use KTplay management tools to express ourselves to the players (such as KTplay
                            in-game messaging and reward sending)









 Anton BelovCEO Mobirate

Talking to our players is very important. We tried web forums but didn’t work well because of
                            the huge gap between a mobile game and it's web page. With KTplay gives us a forum right
                            inside the game and players can enjoy each other's gaming experiences without any friction.
                            This means a big number of players participating in the community and interacting with each
                            other. And the community contents generated and consume by players are ultra fun and
                            rich.









 SJ KimCEO Avocado Entertainment

Before we integrated KTplay, We realized that KTplay is the most convenient and effective
                            community for the mobile gaming users in Korea.









 Eric TanFounder and CEO Fifth Journey
                            

As Fifth Journey is committed in developing great Hollywood games and mobile entertainment
                            experiences, we wanted to have a platform that will allow loyal fans to seamlessly
                            communicate with each other and sharing their proudest moments together – KTPlay was a clear
                            solution to that. As we launched our game, Kubo: A Samurai Quest, it was a great opportunity
                            to hear what our players were excited about and what aspects of the game they enjoyed the
                            most. KTPlay helped foster this communication and provided Fifth Journey the opportunity to
                            engage with our players in the most effective way.









 Wesley BaoCEO Coconut Island

Compared to Wechat, Weibo and other major social networks in China, KTplay is by far the most
                            effective when it comes to building a community full of our passionate players and
                            enthusiastic follwers.









 Oliver MiaoCEO Pixelberry Studios

Our player communities are a super important part of Pixelberry’s success. We had been
                            planning to build our own in-game forums when we discovered KTplay. KTplay is the in-game
                            community solution we’ve been wanting for years. Before our players would be split between
                            our Facebook group and website forums. Now there is one place in our game where they can
                            discuss our game. It’s a no brainer. 










 Henry FongCEO Yodo1 Games

KTplay now sits on our must-have SDK integration list for each and every one of our games.
                            KTplay powers all of our games because we know that our players will benefit from the
                            experience of being able to chat with passionate, like-minded fellow players. With the
                            launch of our latest game, Rodeo Stampede, we're excited to see the content our players
                            create and share with the greater community.
