The advertisements they display on our Site will often contain cookies. Our advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertisements that they believe are relevant. They may use browsing data obtained to restrict the number of times you see particular adverts (frequency capping). You may also see advertisements from these advertisers on other websites you visit.Third parties that support our Site by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate service usage, may also use cookies and other technologies to collect information relevant to the provision of those services. We do not control third party cookies or other technologies. Their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.

Initiative’s website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website at www.aboutads.info/choices and following the directions there. European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance at https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.Your Cookie Choices And How To Opt-OutYou have the choice whether to accept the use of Cookies or “opt out” (in other words, reject Cookies).Most browsers are initially set up to accept HTTP cookies. The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies before accepting or rejecting them, and how to disable existing cookies. For more information about HTTP cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at Your Ad Choices and/or http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies.You can opt-out of additional third-party advertising networks by going to the Network Advertising Initiative’s website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website at www.aboutads.info/choices and following the directions there. European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance at https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/. To opt out of ads on Facebook, Pinterest, or Google that are targeted to your interests, use your Facebook, Pinterest, or Google Ads settings.Check your mobile device for settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device. For example, on your iOS device, enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting, and on your Android device, enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting.We are not responsible for the effectiveness of any such opt-out options. California residents are entitled to know the effects of opt-out options under California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b)(7). The effect of an opt-out, if successful, will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain legitimate business purposes (e.g., research, analytics and internal Site operation purposes).Controlling the HTML5 local storage on your browser depends on which browser you use. For more information regarding your specific browser, please consult the browser’s website (often in the “Help” section).Please note that without HTTP cookies and HTML5 and Flash local storage, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Site features and parts of the Site will not function properly.Please note that rejecting Cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site.Consentp{If you do not opt out (as provided in Section 4 – Your Cookie Choices And How To Opt-Out) you expressly consent to the collection, use,and sharing of your personal data by us and the third parties listed above in Section 3- Use Of Cookies And Tracking Technologies By Our Third-Party Advertising Partners, subject to their privacy policies, preferences, and opt-outs available. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you expressly consent to the use of Cookies and the collection, use and sharing of your personal data by us and by each Google entity identified in the table set forth in Section 3- Use Of Cookies And Tracking Technologies By Our Third-Party Advertising Partners.}You can revoke your consent at any time by following the procedures set forth in Section 4 – Your Cookie Choices And How To Opt-Out).DefinitionsCookiesA cookie (sometimes referred to as local storage object or LSO) is a data file placed on a device. Cookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to as “browser cookies”), HTML5, or Adobe Flash. For more information on third-party cookies that we use for analytics, please review the table of cookies and tracking technologies within this Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy.Web BeaconsSmall graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) can be included in our online service’s pages and messages. Web beacons are invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.Deterministic Finger-printing TechnologiesIf a user can be positively identified across multiple devices, for instance, because the user has logged into a platform such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo or Twitter, it can be “determined” who the user is for purposes of improving customer service.Probabilistic Finger-printingProbabilistic tracking depends upon collecting non-personal data regarding device attributes like operating system, device make and model, IP addresses, ad requests and location data, and making statistical inferences to link multiple devices to a single user. Note that this is accomplished through proprietary algorithms owned by the companies performing probabilistic finger-printing. Note also that in the EU IP Addresses are personal information.Device GraphDevice graphs can be created by combining non-personal data regarding use of smartphones and other devices with personal log-in information to track interactions with content across multiple devices.Unique Identifier Header (UIDH)“Unique Identifier Header (UIDH) is the address information that accompanies Internet (http) requests transmitted over an ISP’s wireless network. For example, when a customer types on his or her phone the web address of a retailer that request travels over the network and is delivered to the retailer’s website. The information included in that request includes things like the device type and screen size so that the retailer site knows how to best display the site on the phone. The UIDH is included in this information, and can be used as an anonymous way for advertisers to be able to determine that the user is part of a group that a third-party advertiser is attempting to reach. It is important to note that the UIDH is a temporary, anonymous identifier included with unencrypted web traffic. We change the UIDH on a regular basis to protect the privacy of our customers. We do not use the UIDH to collect web browsing information and it does not broadcast individuals’ web browsing activity out to advertisers or others.”Embedded ScriptAn embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the online service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the online service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.ETag, or Entity TagA feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of device identifier. ETag tracking generates unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.Unique Device TokensFor each user that accepts push notifications in mobile apps, the app developer is provided with a unique device token (think of it as an address) from the app platform (e.g., Apple and Google).Unique Device IDThe unique series of numbers and letters assigned to your deviceContact UsFor any queries in relation to this Cookie Policy, please contact us at legal@evolvemediallc.com.
