Eat & DrinkCrumbl Cookies holds grand opening for first New Braunfels franchiseCookies are pink this week for breast cancer awareness.Warren BrownOct. 15, 2022

Fast growing fresh cookie franchise Crumbl Cookies held a grand opening for its first store in New Braunfels, which also happens to be the only location between San Antonio and Austin for Hill Country folks feeling like the cookie monster.
Crumbl, based in Utah, is known for its large Instagram-friendly cookies and bright pink packaging, not to mention their moist texture and punch of flavor. Cookie selections rotate on a weekly basis, with several of this week's being pink to direct attention to breast cancer awareness.
 Because I'm very committed to my job, I tried all of this week's six flavors. That carries a price tag of $22.50, while a box of four or a single cookie clock in at $14.63 and $4.50, respectively. If you're treating friends, family, or coworkers, a box of 12 cookies will set you back $38.25. 




 They ain't cheap.
Are they worth it? It feels like more bang for your buck than competitors like Tiffs Treats, but you may have to split the cookies up to feed as many people.

Crumbl Cookies' first franchise is open in New Braunfels.


 But honestly, the cookies are big enough that it's not a bad idea to do so anyway. I didn't complete any of the six cookies in my taste test, but not for lack of desire. They're just ... large.
The Milk Chocolate Chip is a menu staple and stays on the menu. It's thick, moist, and the chips are melty. It's as good as anything your grandma ever made. The Pink Velvet Cake cookie is probably the most Instagrammable of this week's six, but the cream cheese frosting is the only thing that sets it apart flavor-wise. It was an addition I was glad to have.
Now, the Raspberry Lemonade was the one I wanted to be my favorite and it probably was if we are only focused on flavor, but the frosting was actually taller than the cookie at the center. A bit unwieldy and slightly overpowering, but maybe scrape some of that off and you're in the money.
The Pink Donut is instantly recognizable as what would be Homer Simpson's preferred cookie. This one is mostly sugar cookie but has a nice crunch thanks to the sprinkles. The Classic Pink Sugar cookie is the sleeper of the bunch and is an elevated take on the box of sugar cookies in the grocery store. If you're a fan of those, this is a must-have.

 Last was the Cake Batter Blondie. To be perfectly honest, at this point my tongue was practically vibrating from all the sugar coursing through my veins. Tasty? Yes. Pretty to look at? Of course.

 The New Braunfels store is the fourth franchise for husband and wife owners Connor and Paige Tews who have three other locations in the San Antonio area. The transition into cookies was perhaps natural for Connor who ran a donut truck with a friend while in school.
"Cookies, it's just something we fell in love with," Connor told MySA.
