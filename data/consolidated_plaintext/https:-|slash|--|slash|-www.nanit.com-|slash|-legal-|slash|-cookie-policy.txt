Cookie Policy



 We use in our site https://www.nanit.com/ (“Site”) cookies and similar files or technologies to automatically collect and store information about your computer, device, and Site usage, in order to improve their performance and enhance your user experience. We use the general term “cookies” in this policy to refer to these technologies and all such similar technologies that collect information automatically when you are using our Site where this policy is posted.  You can find out more about cookies and how to control them in the information below.If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please disable them using the instructions in this cookie policy or by changing your browser settings so that cookies from this Site cannot be placed on your computer or mobile device. Important: disabling cookies on this Site may seriously cripple the user experience and other features on the Site, to the point of rendering them useless.In this Cookies Policy, we use the term Nanit (and "we", "us" and "our") to refer to Udisense, Inc. Our Privacy Policy is available at https://www.nanit.com/legal/privacy.What is a cookie?Cookies are computer files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.  Cookies can then be sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the website.Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our Site before or whether you are a new visitor.There are two broad categories of cookies:First party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device.Third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf.  We use third party cookies for performance, analytics, marketing and other technologies, and social media purposes.Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are 'permanent cookies', meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.Web beacons:Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are small graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our website. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our website from an online advertisement displayed on a third party website, to improve website performance and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In most instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function, and therefore declining cookies prevents them from functioning.If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies as described further below. If you turn off cookies, web beacon and other technologies will still detect your visits to our Site; however, they will not be associated with information otherwise stored in cookies.Targeted advertisingThird parties may drop cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our website.
