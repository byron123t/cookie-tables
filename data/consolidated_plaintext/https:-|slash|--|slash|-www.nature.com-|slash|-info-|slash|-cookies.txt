Cookie Policy


The website uses cookies. You can deactivate or block cookies either by changing the settings within our Privacy Preference Centre or within your Browser.
Please note that if you deactivate cookie groups from the Privacy Preference Centre and save your changes, then those groups will only be deactivated the next time you visit the site, or by refreshing the page. Additionally you can then remove the cookies from your machine using the methods described below.
About cookies
Cookies are files, often including unique identifiers, that are sent by web servers to web browsers, and which may then be sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. 
Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website, and to identify users returning to a website.
Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. 
Cookies on the website
We use both session cookies and persistent cookies on the website. 
How we use cookies
Cookies do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but personal information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. The cookies used on the website include those which are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies), remember your choices (functionality cookies), and cookies that provide you with targeted content or advertising.
We may use the information we obtain from your use of our cookies for the following purposes:

to recognise your computer when you visit the website
to track you as you navigate the website, and to enable the use of any e-commerce facilities
to improve the website's usability
to analyse the use of the website
in the administration of the website
to personalise the website for you, including targeting advertisements which may be of particular interest to you.

For more information on managing advertising personalisation through your Google account please visit this page.
Third party cookies
When you use the website, you may also be sent third party cookies. 
Our advertisers and service providers may send you cookies. They may use the information they obtain from your use of their cookies:

to track your browser across multiple websites
to build a profile of your web surfing
to target advertisements which may be of particular interest to you. 

In addition to the information we provide in this Cookie Policy, you can find out more information about your online choices at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/opt-out-help
Blocking cookies
You can block cookies by group using our Privacy Preference Centre. In addition to this most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. For example:

Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites. If you block cookies, you may not be able to use certain features on the website (log on, access content, use search functions).
