The Site also includes the following domains: apidocs.pingidentity.com, developer.pingidentity.com, support.pingidentity.com, and documentation.pingidentity.com. This Cookie Policy explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.   What are cookies? Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a Site.  Cookies are widely used by Site owners in order to make their Sites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.   Cookies set by us are called "first party cookies".  Cookies set by parties other than us are called "third party cookies".  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Site (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).  The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Site in question and also when it visits certain other Sites.     Why do we use cookies? We use first party and third-party cookies for several reasons.  Some cookies are required for our Sites and Service Offerings to operate, and we refer to these as "Necessary" cookies.  Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Sites. Third parties serve cookies through our Sites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.     Preferences for cookies (other than Necessary cookies, which may not be adjusted as the Site or Service Offering cannot function without them) may be adjusted at any time through Cookie Preferences (found on the banner at the bottom of the page), or by changing your browser settings to block or delete cookies.  For more information on adjusting browser settings, please see “How can I control cookies?”    The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Sites and Service Offerings, and the purposes they perform, are described in the table below:        Necessary cookies are essential to providing you with services available through our Sites and to use some features, such as access to secure areas.   First parties serving Necessary cookies: • Ping Identity Note: PingID, our MFA Service Offering, will also serve a “pid” cookie to our customer’s workforce, partners or their customers who are using the PingID Desktop App. This cookie influences the behaviour of the PingID Policy configured by customer administrators and controls the authentication process. Third parties serving Necessary cookies:  CookieBot Formsite Google Tag Manager Marketo Coveo     Performance cookies allow us to monitor website visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Sites. They help us find out which pages visitors go to most often and understand how visitors navigate our Sites. All the information in these cookies collect is in aggregate form and therefore anonymous.    First parties serving Performance cookies:  none   Third parties serving Performance cookies:  Google Analytics Hirebridge (prospective staff candidates) Slideshare (LinkedIn) Evergage Engagio Inspectlet    Functionality cookies are used to provide enhanced functionality and personalization on our Sites. They remember choices you make (such as your language preferences or the region you are in) and provide more personal features such as tailored content and fully functioning live chat. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.    First parties serving Functionality cookies:  None   Third parties serving Functionality cookies:  Drift    Targeting cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. The intention is to display ads that are engaging for the individual user and thereby more valuable for publishers and third-party advertisers. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.    First parties serving Targeting cookies:  None   Third parties serving Targeting cookies:  DoubleClick (Google) AdSense (Google Display Network) Google Facebook LinkedIn ScorecardResearch           What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons? Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a Site. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels” or “clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited or revisited our Site. This allows us, for example, to:  Monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page to the next; Deliver or communicate with cookies; Understand whether you have come to our Site from another site; Improve Site performance; and Measure the success of email marketing campaigns.      How do we use Google Analytics? Our Site uses Google Analytics, an internet analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies that help the website to analyse user behaviour. User behaviour is captured by the cookie and then transmitted to and stored by Google in the United States. Ping has enabled the IP address anonymization feature for our Site. This feature of the Google Analytics Collection Network service truncates the IP address of individuals from EEA member states before being forwarded to the analytics engine. Any visitor may opt out from Google Analytics across our Site by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.   How can I control cookies? You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies through controls provided within your browser. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but some functionalities may be degraded or inoperable, and access to some areas of our Site may be restricted. As browser controls for controlling cookies vary from browser-to-browser, we recommend visiting your browser's help menu for more information.   For your convenience, we have provided links to more information for some of the most commonly used browsers:  Google Chrome Microsoft Edge Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Internet Explorer Opera Apple Safari    Alternatively, most web browsers allow some level of control for most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set, visit www.aboutcookies.org.   Additionally, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising.  If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.   How often will you update this Cookie Notice? We may update this Cookie Notice from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.  Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.   Where can I get further information?
