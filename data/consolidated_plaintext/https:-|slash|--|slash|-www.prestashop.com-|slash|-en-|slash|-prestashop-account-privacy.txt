3.4. Transfer of your Data to the authorities to comply with our legal obligations
 
Lastly, we may also disclose your Data :
 

To comply with legal mandates, laws and legal procedures, including governmental and regulatory requests.
If we deem that disclosure is required or appropriate within the scope of protecting the rights, ownership or security of PrestaShop, our clients and other stakeholders. This disclosure includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purpose of protecting against fraud and counterfeiting.

 
3.5. Links to third party sites
 
The Site may contain links to various social networking platforms maintained on third party servers, by persons or organizations over which PrestaShop has no control.
 
Therefore, we cannot be held responsible for the way your Data will be stored or used on the servers of these third parties.
 
We recommend that you review the applicable data protection policy of each third party website you access through our Site to understand how your Data will be used.
 
4. HOW LONG IS MY DATA STORED FOR ?
 
PrestaShop only stores your Data for as long as necessary. This retention period is not the same depending on the Data in question, the nature and purpose of the collection being likely to vary this period. Similarly, certain legal obligations impose a specific retention period.
 
The User's IP address collected after registration to the PrestaShop Account service is kept for thirty (30) days and then deleted.
 
The Data collected through cookies and other tracers are kept for a period of thirteen (13) months from their collection.
 
Finally, we retain some of your Data for a longer period if necessary for legitimate business purposes or if required by law (whether for security purposes, financial records, or fraud and abuse prevention).
 
When you delete or request the deletion of your Data, we will ensure that it is effectively deleted or retained in anonymised form.
 
 
5. HOW IS MY DATA PROTECTED?
 
Your Data is stored on secure servers protected by firewalls and antivirus software.
 
We have implemented technical and organisational measures intended to protect the security and confidentiality of your Data against any accidental loss and any unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure.
 
Given the inherent characteristics of the internet, we cannot guarantee the optimal security of information exchanged over this network.
 
We strive to protect your Data , but cannot guarantee the absolute security of information sent to the Services. You agree that you provide your Data at your own risk. 
 
We cannot be held liable for any failure to comply with privacy settings and security measures implemented on our Services.                                                                                        
 
As such, you agree that the security of your information is equally your responsibility. For instance, you are responsible for keeping your Merchant Website back-office password confidential.
 
Never provide it to any third parties. Similarly, be careful when you share information in the public sections of the Website as they can be viewed by all Website users.
 
6. WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS?
 
You can choose how the Data you provide is used :
 

You can decide not to provide your email address in the PrestaShop Account form. However, please be aware that you cannot use PrestaShop Account and Services in this case.
