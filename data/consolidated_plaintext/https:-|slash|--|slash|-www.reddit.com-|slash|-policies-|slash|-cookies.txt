Cookie Notice

Last updated September 15, 2020.

      This Cookie Notice explains how we use cookies and similar technologies as well as the options
      you have to control them.
    


What are cookies and how does Reddit use them?


        A cookie is a small text file that a site stores on your computer or mobile device when you
        visit the site. Browsers support cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage and
        pixels) so that a site like Reddit can remember information about your visit and can use the
        information to improve your experience and to create aggregated anonymized statistics about
        usage of the site. In this Notice, we use the term “cookie” to refer both to cookies and
        similar technologies.Cookies may be set by the site you are visiting (called
        “first-party cookies”) or by a third party, such as those who provide analytics or
        advertising services or interactive content on the site (“third-party cookies”). In addition
        to using cookies on our sites, we may also serve our cookies (specifically, our advertising
        pixel) on third-party sites operated by Reddit advertisers who use our advertising
        technology.Our first-party cookies include cookies that are strictly necessary,
        functional cookies, cookies related to analytics/performance and advertising-related
        cookies.
      



Strictly Necessary: These cookies are necessary for our services to function
        properly and securely and cannot be switched off in our systems. You can set your browser to
        block or alert you about these cookies, but then some parts of the site will not work. These
        include:

Functional: These cookies enable Reddit to provide enhanced functionality and
        personalization. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these features may
        not function properly.
      



Analytics and Performance: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic
        sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know
        which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.
      



Advertising: We use these cookies to deliver advertisements, to make them more
        relevant and meaningful to users, and to track the efficiency of our advertising campaigns,
        both on our services and on other sites or mobile apps. Our third-party advertising partners
        may use these cookies to build a profile of your interests and deliver relevant advertising
        on other sites.




Third-Party Cookies: Reddit’s services also include cookies from third parties that
        we partner with directly or indirectly. Many of these third parties are companies that work
        with us or with advertisers who advertise on Reddit in order to help target ads or measure
        the results of an advertising campaign.




Third-Party Sites: Third parties who advertise on Reddit may use our advertising
        technology, including our advertising pixel, on their sites. We may serve advertising
        cookies when you visit their sites so that we can measure the effectiveness of ads on Reddit
        and to show you more relevant advertising on Reddit. The placement of these cookies is
        controlled by the third-party sites.

        you visit. Most browsers have features that enable you to see and delete cookies stored on
        your device and to block cookies from all or selected sites. For more information, here are
        links to external help materials from some of the popular browsers:

        Your mobile device may also include browser settings that allow you to manage the use of
        cookies, especially if the device supports installing apps such as iOS and Android devices.
        iOS and Android devices also include additional device settings that control whether
        advertising partners can use information about your app activity for advertising purposes.
        On iOS, you can search for a setting called Limit Ad Tracking. On Android, you can
        search for a setting called Opt out of Ads Personalization.

        sites from the
        Network Advertising Initiative, the
        Digital Advertising Alliance, and for users in
        the EU, the
