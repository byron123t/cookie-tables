This cookie policy (“Cookie Policy”) describes the cookies and other technologies used on this website (the “Site”) by © Gannett Co., Inc. and its affiliated local media companies (“Gannett”, “Gatehouse” “we”, “us” or “our”).
We have created this Cookie Policy to explain what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. This Cookie Policy forms part of our Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you consent to the practices described in this Cookie Policy and the Privacy Policy and to the updates to these policies posted here from time to time.

1. What Is A Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website places on your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information. Cookies work by assigning a number to the browser that has no meaning outside the assigned website. Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time. "Session cookies" only last for as long as the browser session and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. "Persistent cookies" cookies survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined by the party placing it), and help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again. 
We may also use pixel tags (usually in combination with cookies) to get information about your usage of the Site and about your interaction with email or other communications. Pixel tags are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in online content or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites (for example, to know when content has been shown to you), or to know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message.
For more details on cookies and similar technologies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org
Please Note, If you limit the use of certain cookies, you may be unable to benefit from the Site’s full functionality.
2. How We Use The Information We Collect Through Cookies
Cookies help us recognize repeat users and allow us to track web usage behavior. Aggregated cookie data helps us enhance our products and services. For example, the data helps us learn which content is popular. Most importantly, Cookies are used for the functionality of the website such as remembering your login status and user preferences. These cookies will enable us to customize the materials we provide to you based on your online interests and preferences. Cookies may also assist with our promotional, event, contest and marketing efforts. (including behavioral advertising)
Gannett uses both first-party cookies as well as third-party cookies to enhance your online experience by allowing us to display relevant content and advertising. First party cookies are placed on a website directly by the owner of the site, in this case, Gannett. Third party cookies are placed on a website by third party providers (for example, by companies that provide advertising tracking or web analytics services) and by advertisers on the website. This data collection takes place on our sites, apps and emails, and on third party websites and apps.
3. Third Party Cookies
We work with third parties to support the Site by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content, customizing content based on usage, or tracking aggregate site usage statistics. These third parties use their Cookies to collect information on the site and we may not have access to these Cookies, although we may use information from the Cookies provided by these third parties to customize content and for the other purposes. These companies may also transfer this information to other parties where required to do so by law, or where such other parties process the information on their behalf. The information, which may be combined with other information acquired from third parties such as demographics and other marketing segment information, may be used by the third party to serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.
You can learn how to manage cookies in section Manage your cookies Section. However, we may not control these third party Cookies and their use may be governed by the policies of the third parties employing these Cookies.
