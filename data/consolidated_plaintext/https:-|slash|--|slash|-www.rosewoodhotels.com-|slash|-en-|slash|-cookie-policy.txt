Cookie Policy




 Cookie Settings









Last Updated: 5 October 2022  
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Cookie Policy applies to any website or service (collectively “Services”) of Rosewood Hotel Group and its affiliates that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. The terms “Rosewood”, “we”, “us” as used in this Cookie Policy collectively refer to Rosewood Hotel Group and its affiliates.
2 WHAT IS COOKIE?
2.1 Rosewood uses cookies and other technologies to enable features at the Services, in e-mails or e-mail advertisements, or in advertisements on other Services (hereafter referred to as “Cookies”). A Cookie is a small text file that stores Internet settings. Almost every website uses Cookie technology. Cookies, among other things, speed navigation through our Services, keep track of information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Services, help us provide you with customized content and allow us to learn about your visit. We also use web beacons (also called web bugs, pixel tags, or clear GIFs) primarily to collect and maintain aggregated data (such as the number of visitors) to help us see which areas are most popular with our users and improve and update the content on our Services. Web beacons also help us measure the effectiveness of our online advertising and/or e-mail campaigns by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit our Services or the number of individuals who open or act upon an e-mail message. Some of the information we collect using web beacons may be personally identifiable. We may combine this information with other Personal Data we have collected about you to better tailor our marketing or Services content to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as internal research.
2.2 Some Cookies require your consent, while others are exempt.
2.2.1 Cookies exempt from consent: Strictly necessary Cookies guarantee functions without which you would not be able to use the Services as intended. They are stored on your computer during your current browser session. Your consent is not required for strictly necessary Cookies.
2.2.2 Cookies subject to consent: Other Cookies that are not strictly necessary to use the Services still fulfil important tasks. Without these Cookies, we may not be able to provide certain functions intended for your convenience on our Services, such as your personal settings or automatic filling in form functions.
2.3 First-Party Cookies: Some of the Cookies are used exclusively by Rosewood, and therefore are called “first-party Cookies”. These Cookies include functional Cookies to remember a user’s language selection or performance Cookies to identify repeated website visits from the same user. Other permanent Cookies include those use to improve the user experience on our Services, including recording whether a user closed an auto pop-up message so that we do not display it again.
2.4 Third-Party Cookies: Rosewood uses third-party service providers for analytics and to help us manage, carry out and improve our advertising, including Adobe, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Clarity, Sojern, Triptease, Olpaic, Xandar, and Microsoft. These parties may set Cookies to help us collect information and provide you with advertisements that we believe would be relevant for you. These third parties also may assist us by providing certain statistical and analytics information in relation to our marketing practices.
2.5 Types of Cookies We Use. Rosewood uses four types of Cookies: strictly necessary Cookies, performance Cookies, functional Cookies, and Cookies for advertising purposes.
2.5.1 Strictly necessary Cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Services and use its features. These temporary Cookies only last as long as your web browser is open, and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation on our Services. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided – for example, remembering previous actions (e.g. entered text) when navigating back to a page in the same session, showing a version that has a broad-band-related data quantity corresponding to that of the Internet connection you are using and guaranteeing that, when you change pages, the function of changing from http to https takes place. Cookies of this type also store your decision regarding the use of Cookies on our Services. Once you close your browser, these Cookies disappear.
