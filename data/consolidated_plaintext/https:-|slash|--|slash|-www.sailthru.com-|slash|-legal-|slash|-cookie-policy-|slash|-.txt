Cookie Notice
LAST UPDATED:  April 29, 2020
This Cookie Notice explains how and why Sailthru (collectively “Sailthru”, "we", "us", and "ours") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you, as well as track and analyse your actions when you visit our websites at sailthru.com,  ("Websites"). We also provide information related to how and why those same technologies are applied to tracking and analysing logged-in users of our software application (“Services”) and recipients of emails sent through our Services by users of our Services.  Information about what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them, can be found below.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.  Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. 
We refer to cookies created by us as "first party cookies".  We refer to cookies that we set on our website but that are created by parties other than us as "third party cookies".  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).  The parties that provide these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites. 
In addition to the party which sets the cookie, the duration of the cookie’s retention in your browser can help define its purpose. Session cookies are cookies which are stored on your device for the duration of the browser session. When you close your browser, the session cookies are cleared. Persistent cookies are stored either until you manually delete them or until your browser deletes them based on the duration set within the persistent cookie file.
Why we use cookies
We use both first and third party cookies for several reasons. First, let’s look at the broad categories of first and third party cookies in use on our sites:

Essential website cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Refusal of these cookies may impact website functionality.
Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use.  However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
Analytics and customisation cookies: These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective are marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our Websites for you.
Advertising cookies: These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.  They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously re-appearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
Social networking cookies: These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Websites through third party social networking and other websites.  These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.

The information collected and stored by cookies and other tracking technologies likely meets the GDPR’s definition of personal data. The GDPR defines 'personal data' as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person". Personal data collected by the cookies and related technologies described below would include your location, information about your browsing behavior on this or other sites, and information you provide via forms or single fields on this site. This personal data will be used only in the manners described by this notice and our Privacy Notice.
