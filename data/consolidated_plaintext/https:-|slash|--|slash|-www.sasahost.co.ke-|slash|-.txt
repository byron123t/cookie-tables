Which Hosting Plan is suitable for you? 

























If you have a small static website with low to moderate amounts of traffic, our Basic Web Hosting Plans may be a good option. If you have an active Business or Organization website, or are creating a website which you expect to have moderate to high amounts of traffic, e.g. active blogs, medium e-commerce portals, fairly active web shops, medium directory listings, active CMS sites or other Memory intensive Applications then you should consider our Business Hosting Plans. If you have a large and popular web shop, highly popular or large blog, large CMS website or highly active e-commerce portal with very high volumes of traffic and intensive resource requirements, or you need full server control with root access then a VPS or Dedicated server is your option, depending on the size or complexity of your project.
