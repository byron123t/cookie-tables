California Consumer Privacy Act Disclosures
 
Last Updated: October 13, 2022.
This California Consumer Privacy Act Disclosure (“Disclosure”) supplements the Shopbop Privacy Notice and is effective as of October 13, 2022. The Shopbop Privacy Notice describes the personal information that we collect, the sources from which we collect it, the purposes for which we use it, the limited circumstances under which we share personal information, and with whom we share it. These additional disclosures are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act:

Cookies Notice
 
We use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively, "cookies") to recognize your browser or device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with essential features and services and for additional purposes, including:

 Recognizing you when you sign-in to use our services. This allows us to provide you with product recommendations, display personalized content, and provide other customized features and services. 
Keeping track of your specified preferences. This allows us to honor your preferences, such as your language of choice. You may set your preferences through your “My Account” page.  
Keeping track of items stored in your shopping basket. 
Conducting research and diagnostics to improve Shopbop’s content, products, and services. 
Preventing fraudulent activity. 
Improving security. 
Delivering content, including ads, relevant to your interests on Shopbop.com, EastDane.com, and third-party sites (see the Interest-Based Ads notice for how we use cookies in serving interest-based ads). 
Reporting. This allows us to measure and analyze the performance of our services. 

 
Shopbop’s cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Shopbop’s essential features. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Shopbop products and services that require you to sign in.
Approved third parties may also set cookies when you interact with Shopbop services. Third parties include providers of analytics services and advertising companies. Third parties use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to perform services on behalf of Shopbop.
You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings. The 'Help' feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to block cookies, and when cookies will expire. If you block all cookies on your browser, neither we nor third parties will transfer cookies to your browser. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some features and services may not work.
 
Shopbop Interest-Based Ads Notice
 
Interest-Based Ads
Interest-based ads are sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads. We show interest-based ads to display features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. In providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations).
What sort of information do we use to show interest-based ads?
To serve you interest-based ads, we use information such as your interactions with our sites, content, or services. We do not use information which on its own identifies you, such as name or e-mail address, to serve interest-based ads.
As is common in the advertising industry, we use cookies, pixels, and other technologies (collectively, “cookies”), which enable us to understand the effectiveness of the interest-based ads we show you by measuring what ads are clicked or viewed, and to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads are shown to your browser we can be careful not to show the same ads repeatedly.
See our Privacy Notice [CTA] for more information about the types of information that we gather.
How do we work with third parties to show you interest-based ads?
We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search engines, ad serving companies, and advertising companies working on their behalf, to improve the relevance of ads we serve. In providing you interest-based ads we do not associate your interactions on unaffiliated sites with information which on its own identifies you, such as name or email address, and we do not provide any such information to advertisers or to third-party sites that display our interest-based ads. Advertisers and other third parties may assume that users who interact with or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who purchased or browsed for classical music). Some third-parties may provide us pseudonymized information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.
Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads, directly to your browser or device, and they may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform services on behalf of Shopbop. For information on how to control and delete cookies (including third party cookies) please visit our Cookies notice.
Advertising Preferences
Shopbop serves interest-based ads through third party ad networks. You can generally opt out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.
