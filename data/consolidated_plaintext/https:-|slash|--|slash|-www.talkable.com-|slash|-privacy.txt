5. Change of Purpose
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please us at security@talkable.com.
If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
PLEASE NOTE THAT WE MAY PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE RULES, WHERE THIS IS REQUIRED OR PERMITTED BY LAW.



6. Non-Personal Data We Collect from You
6.1. Non-Personal Data. Non-Personal Data means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Non-Personal Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.
6.2. Log Data. When you visit the Site, we automatically collect technical and statistical data about your visit, such as your browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data, the pages you visit and any search terms you use (“Log Data”).
6.3. IP Address. We also collect your public IP address when you visit the Site. We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer). Because you may be visiting the Site from your personal residence (for example, because you are telecommuting), your IP address and any associated domain name are treated as “Personal Network Information” instead of Personal Data. “Log Data” does not include Personal Network Information. Although such Personal Network Information may be used to administer and maintain the Site and Services, it is not shared with any third parties, except as described below in the sections titled “Service Providers,” “Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement” and “Business Transfers”. We will use Log Data for any purpose.
PLEASE NOTE: DEPENDING ON YOUR JURISDICTION YOUR IP ADDRESS MAY BE CONSIDERED PERSONAL DATA. IN ALL SUCH CASES IT WILL BE ACCORDINGLY TREATED AS SUCH.
6.4. Cookies. We use many different cookies on our Site. If you do not know what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we recommend you visit aboutcookies.org for detailed guidance. Cookies allow us to identify and authenticate visitors, track aggregate behavior, and enable important website features. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period, and we use that to identify you should you return to our Site and want to find information that you had started even if you are not logged in, or don’t have a user account. Session cookies are used to maintain your shopping state as you browse through our Site. We also contract with analytics services and third party affiliate services to collect similar information for specific purposes. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Though you may disable cookies through your web browser, doing so may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Site’s features. To opt out of these collection services, please see the section “Your Choices” below. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by this Policy. To opt out of the services related to these cookies, please see section “Your Choices” below. Please note that if you block certain of these cookies, certain features of our Services may not work.
– Some of our cookies may collect your Personal Data. Specifically, Talkable may utilize uuid cookies, which may collect your first name, last name, email address, Custom Attributes, or IP address.
6.5. Web Beacons/Tags. We automatically collect aggregate anonymous information through web beacons. Website beacons allow third parties to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us.
6.6. Use of Non-Personal Data. We may also use your Log Data and Personal Network Information to: (i) administer our Site and Services for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes; (ii) improve our Site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your device; (iii) allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service and Site, when you choose to do so; (iv) as part of our efforts to keep our Site and Services safe and secure.
6.7. Pixel Tags. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to users. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to Personal Data.
6.8. Flash LSOs. When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here.
6.9. Google Analytics. We may use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit our Site and Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other Personally Data. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on Your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site and use Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Site and use of Services are governed by the Google Analytics’ Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.



7. Aggregated Data
After removing any information that would personally identify you from within the set of Personal Data, Personal Network Information and Log Data we collect from you, we may combine that information with information we collect from other users and customers (collectively the “Aggregated Data”) in order to improve the quality and value of Services and to analyze and understand how our Site is used. We may share Aggregated Data (after stripping of any information that would personally identify you) and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes.



8. Your Choices
8.1. How You Can Access or Correct Your Information. You can access a variety of your Personal Data that we collect online and maintain it either online, or by contacting our customer service representatives via email at support@talkable.com .

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
8.2. How You Can Request for Your Information To Be Deleted.

Cookies. You may disable, or delete cookies in your Web browser, but doing so may impact the usability of the website. To block cookies, you can also browse the site using your browser’s anonymous usage setting (called “Incognito” in Chrome, “InPrivate” for Internet Explorer, “Private Browsing” in Firefox and Safari etc.)



9. Information Sharing & Disclosure
9.1. Service Providers. We may from time to time use certain third-party business partners, suppliers, and sub-contractors (“Services Providers” or “Subprocessors”) to perform Site-related services (for example, without limitation, website hosting, maintenance services, database management, Web analytics, and improvement of our Site and Services. These Service Providers have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. For a list of Talkable’s current Subprocessors, please see here.
9.2. Merchants. If you are participating in the Talkable Programs, we will also share your Personal Data with the Merchant (as that term is defined in the applicable Talkable Program’s Terms of Service) in order to provide the functionality of the Services (as that term is defined in the Talkable Referral Program Terms of Service). The Merchant may contact you in relation to Merchant’s own goods and/or services, or for their own marketing and promotional purposes. In certain cases, we may also share behavioral information, including how you interact with the Services (as defined in the applicable Talkable Program’s Terms of Service). While this behavioral information may not personally identify you on its own, this information may be combined with other Personal Data, either by us or the Merchant.
9.3. Compliance with laws and law enforcement. Talkable cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose your Personal Data to government or law enforcement officials or private parties in response to lawful requests if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Data in order to comply with any legal obligation (such as to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or respond to claims and legal process, to protect the property and rights of Talkable or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity (including for the purposes of fraud protection).
9.4. Business Transfers/Corporate Restructuring. If Talkable is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via e-mail and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.
9.5. Affiliates. We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other company’s under a common control (“Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.



10. California Privacy Rights

10.2. California Do Not Track Disclosure. Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, we do not recognize or respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals and we will still receive information. As a result, we may still collect information about you and your internet activity, even if you have turned on the Do Not Track signal. It is possible that some or all of our third-party advertising partners or members of their affiliate network may participate in consumer opt-out programs. To learn more about internet-based advertising and consumer opt-out programs go to https://aboutads.info/choices/ or https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. We do not operate or control these sites, and are not responsible for the opt-out choices available there.
10.3 California Consumer Privacy Act. For purposes of this Section 10.3 only, the terms “personal information,” “collection,” “sell,” “business purpose” and “commercial purpose” have the meaning given to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”).
If you reside in California, you have certain rights set forth below. These rights are in addition to any other rights you may have under this Policy. If you have any questions about these rights or how to exercise them, please contact us at support@talkable.com . Please note that we may disclose your personal information for business or commercial purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. For more information about the categories of personal information we collect, the sources from which we collect personal information and how use, disclose and share such information, please see Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Privacy Policy.
Disclosure and deletion requests. You have the right to request that we disclose to you what personal information about you we collect, use, disclose and sell. Subject to certain limitations in the CCPA, you also have the right to request that we delete your personal information. You may submit such a request by contacting us at support@talkable.com, writing us at the address listed in Section 24, submitting an online request form. If you submit a request by email, your email must include “California Request” in the subject line. We will only use personal information provided in an online quest form to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
Right to opt out. The CCPA also provides California consumers the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. As explained in this Policy, we do not sell the personal information of our users.
Verification. We reserve the right to verify any request made under the CCPA by asking you to provide supporting documentation that the request is submitted by you, although we are not obligated to verify a request. You may also choose to have an agent submit a request on your behalf, in which case we may, but are not obligated to, verify that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf. We assume no responsibility for responding to any consumer requests.
10.4 Financial Incentive Notice. As part of a Talkable Program, Merchants may offer you various financial incentives such as discounts and special offers when you provide your contact information and identifiers such as your name and email address. When you sign-up for a Talkable Program, you opt-in to a financial incentive. You may withdraw from a financial incentive at any time by contacting us at support@talkable.com or writing us at the address listed in Section 24. Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal information, however, California law requires that we assign such value in the context of financial incentives. In such context, the value of the personal information is related to the estimated cost of providing the relevant financial incentive(s) for which the information was collected.



11. International Transfers & Data Processing Agreement
11.1. International Data Transfer. Information collected in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) may be transferred, stored and processed by us and our service providers in the United States and other countries whose data protection laws may be different from the laws of your country. Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by entering into the European Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses pursuant to Decision 2010/87/EU) with the relevant provider.
Please contact us at security@talkable.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data out of the EEA.

12.7. Right to withdraw consent. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data.

13.2. What we may need from you.

We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
13.3. Time limit to respond. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
