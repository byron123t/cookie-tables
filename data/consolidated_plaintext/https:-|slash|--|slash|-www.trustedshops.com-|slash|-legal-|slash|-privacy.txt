Protection of your privacy is very important to us. Below you will find extensive information about how we handle your data. This privacy policy applies to the present website and as well as to the Facebook fan page, the Twitter channel, the Xing profile, the YouTube channel and the Instagram channel. Information and contact details for the responsible person can be found in the imprint.1. Communication via Email, Contact Form or PhoneWe collect personal data if you voluntarily provide it when contacting us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail). Mandatory fields are marked as such since in these cases we require the data for processing your message or for creating a customer account, and you cannot send the message without this information. The specific data that is collected is listed on the respective contact forms. We use the data provided by you to process your enquiries. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, insofar as your message is related to an existing or upcoming contract with you. If this is not the case, the legal basis is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, as the processing is necessary to fulfil our legitimate interest in the proper processing of contact requests. In order to be able to properly allocate enquiries, the provision of personal data is necessary.We have engaged service providers for the technical processing of your communication with us on our behalf. These service providers are based in the USA. Please refer to the information in the section Third Country Transfer regarding the associated risks.After complete processing of the communication, your data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after expiry of the applicable retention periods under tax and commercial law, unless you have explicitly consented to further use of your data, or we have reserved the right to do so, where permissible by law, in which case we shall inform you thereof in this privacy policy.2. Access Data and HostingYou can visit our website without providing any personal information. Every time you visit our website, the web server automatically saves a so-called server logfile which contains data like the name of the requested file, your IP address, date and time of the request, the amount of data transmitted and the requesting provider (all together “access data”), and documents your visit.The access data is evaluated exclusively for the purpose of ensuring the error-free functioning of the site and of improving our services. This is necessary for the protection of our legitimate interests in the proper presentation of our offer which are overriding in the process of balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. All access data will be deleted no later than seven days after the end of your visit to the site.Hosting services through a third party providerThis site is hosted on our behalf by our processor HubSpot, Inc., 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141, US. In order to provide appropriate safeguards, Hubspot and we have agreed on standard data protection clauses issued by the EU Commission in accordance with Art. 46 (2) (c) GDPR. Please also refer to the section on Third Country Transfer.All data collected via the use of these websites or through the forms provided for the purposes described below is processed on the servers of the respective service provider. Processing on other servers only takes place as described within this privacy policy.3.Data Collection and Use in the Context of the Trusted ShopsProductsRegistration for Trusted Shops Basic or Plus for buyersInformation on the processing of personal data in the context of the use of our various services is available when you register for the services, for example as an appendix to the terms of use.Registration for Trusted Shops membership for online shopsInformation on the processing of personal data in connection with the Trusted Shops membership for online shops can be found in the data protection information here.Application for a position with Trusted ShopsInformation on the processing of personal data in the context of applying for a job with Trusted Shops is linked in the job advertisement.4. Third Country TransferIn this section, we inform you about the processing of personal data related to you in third countries for which there is no adequacy decision adopted by the EU Commission.Trusted Shops uses a variety of service providers. Many of them use servers in third countries, i.e. outside the EU or the EEA. This also includes the USA. The transfer of personal data associated with this must be carried out in accordance with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. In July 2020, the ECJ ruled that the Privacy-Shield Agreement between the EU and the USA can no longer be used to transfer personal data to the USA. This means that the sectoral adequacy decision of the EU Commission has been revoked.However, the Privacy Shield as such and the associated self-certification will remain in place. This means that US companies that have self-certified and registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (see overview here) will continue to act in compliance with the Privacy Shield rules, which will ensure a good level of data protection to the greatest extent possible.In addition, Trusted Shops obliges service providers who process personal data in a third country to comply with the standard data protection clauses issued by the EU Commission which are still valid. Where possible, we also agree on additional guarantees to ensure that adequate data protection is guaranteed in the USA or other third countries.For some service providers there are also binding corporate rules, which ensure that European data protection standards are observed within the company.Despite all contractual and technical measures, it is possible that the level of data protection in the third country may not be the same as in the EU. In such cases we will ask you, if necessary, as part of cookie consent, in (contact) forms or in the case of other registrations and notifications, for your consent under Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR to transfer your personal data to a third country. This applies in particular to the transfer of data to the USA. In the USA, authorities and intelligence services may have the right and the capability to access your personal data without our knowledge as the data exporter or yours as the data subject, and without you having sufficient legal means to prevent or take action against such access.By clicking on “Cookie settings” in the footer of this website, you can open the Cookie Manager and find detailed information about all the service providers from third countries that we use, such as the exact countries of residence of the individual service providers, the specific legal basis and the purpose of the data transfer, the duration of the data storage, etc.5.
