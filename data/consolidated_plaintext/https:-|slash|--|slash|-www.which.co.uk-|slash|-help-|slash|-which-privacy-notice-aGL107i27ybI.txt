Affordable food for all
We need to see action from the big supermarkets - including clear pricing, better access to budget ranges that enable healthy choices and more offers for those in need.







Make tech giants take responsibility
Tech companies aren’t doing enough to protect us online from scams, dangerous products and fake reviews. We’re demanding strong new laws that make tech giants do better.







Stamp out scams
Scammers are stealing hundreds of £millions from innocent victims every year, bombarding us with fraudulent texts, emails and calls. And not all banks are reimbursing innocent victims of scams – we’re demanding the government make it compulsory.







Fix bad broadband
Broadband is an essential part of modern life. Yet the service many of us get simply isn’t good enough. Are you getting the broadband speed you were promised? Use our tool to find out.







Transform Travel
We’re calling for a major overhaul of the travel industry. The appalling way airlines have treated passengers by repeatedly cancelling flights last minute and not telling them about their rights is unacceptable.

Affordable food for all
We need to see action from the big supermarkets - including clear pricing, better access to budget ranges that enable healthy choices and more offers for those in need.







Make tech giants take responsibility
Tech companies aren’t doing enough to protect us online from scams, dangerous products and fake reviews. We’re demanding strong new laws that make tech giants do better.







Stamp out scams
Scammers are stealing hundreds of £millions from innocent victims every year, bombarding us with fraudulent texts, emails and calls. And not all banks are reimbursing innocent victims of scams – we’re demanding the government make it compulsory.







Fix bad broadband
Broadband is an essential part of modern life. Yet the service many of us get simply isn’t good enough. Are you getting the broadband speed you were promised? Use our tool to find out.







Transform Travel
We’re calling for a major overhaul of the travel industry. The appalling way airlines have treated passengers by repeatedly cancelling flights last minute and not telling them about their rights is unacceptable.

If you come to our website and decide to buy something from us via those adverts or links, then we will then pay them a small fee. We do this either using cookies, with your consent, or by sharing protected, pseudonymous customer order information with them. The affiliates cannot use this information to identify you.To understand what information is being collected and why, please see our cookie and tracking technologies notice. . We link to a variety of external websites and retailers where you can buy products or services featured on our websites. This includes large retailers such as Amazon and John Lewis and smaller ones which may be specialists. Links are normally provided by an affiliate but we also work directly with retailers in some cases. Please note that a retailer link alone does not constitute an endorsement of the retailer by Which?. We are not able to show every possible retailer and cheaper prices may be available. We provide these links to make it easier for you to complete your purchase and so we can earn commission from referring you. This revenue is used to support our not-for-profit mission. To help us do this, we track your activity using cookies. For more information, and to easily manage your cookie settings, please see our cookie policy.All our research, testing and recommendations are 100% independent. We’re not influenced by third parties and we don't accept freebies from product manufacturers or retailers.Display/contextual advertisingWe advertise our products and services on other websites.We work with an advertising company who decides where it’s best to place our adverts. We usually don’t know where our adverts will appear.  The advertising company will place a cookie on your device when you see the advert. This is so they can monitor how effective the advert is and not show you the same advert too many times. RetargetingWe work with third-party advertising networks and search platforms, such as Google, to show you adverts on other websites or search platforms. These adverts will be about things you’ve previously shown an interest in on our website. The adverts may highlight other products or services we think you’d be interested in, too.  Cookies (as well as tools such as Google Tag Manager) help us to do this.Messaging platformsWe also work with messaging platforms that may deliver messages to your devices on our behalf. We only do this if we have your express consent. These messages will be tailored to the pages and content you have shown interest in. You have the option when each message is delivered to opt out of all future communications.8.
