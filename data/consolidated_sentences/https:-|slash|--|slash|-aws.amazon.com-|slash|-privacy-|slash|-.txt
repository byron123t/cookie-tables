How We Use Personal Information
We use your personal information to operate, provide, and improve AWS Offerings
Our purposes for using personal information include:
Provide AWS Offerings: We use your personal information to provide and deliver AWS Offerings and process transactions related to AWS Offerings, including registrations, subscriptions, purchases, and payments.
Measure, Support, and Improve AWS Offerings: We use your personal information to measure use of, analyze performance of, fix errors in, provide support for, improve, and develop AWS Offerings.
Recommendations and Personalization: We use your personal information to recommend AWS Offerings that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with AWS Offerings.
Comply with Legal Obligations: In certain cases, we have a legal obligation to collect, use, or retain your personal information
For example, we collect bank account information from AWS Marketplace sellers for identity verification.
Communicate with You: We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to AWS Offerings via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat) and to respond to your requests.

Purposes for Which We Seek Your Consent: We may also ask for your consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you.
Cookies
To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide AWS Offerings, we use cookies
For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our Cookie Notice.
How We Share Personal Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others
We share personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc
and the affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc
controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Transactions Involving Third Parties: We make available to you services, software, and content provided by third parties for use on or through AWS Offerings
You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information related to those transactions with that third party
For example, you can order services, software, and content from sellers using the AWS Marketplace and we provide those sellers information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.
Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf
Examples include: delivering AWS hardware, sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training
These third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes
Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services
In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise)
Also, in the unlikely event that AWS or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Us and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of AWS, our customers, or others
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.
At Your Option: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
Location of Personal Information
Amazon Web Services, Inc
is located in the United States, and our affiliated companies are located throughout the world
Depending on the scope of your interactions with AWS Offerings, your personal information may be stored in or accessed from multiple countries, including the United States
Whenever we transfer personal information to other jurisdictions, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.
How We Secure Information
At AWS, security is our highest priority
We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.
We maintain a wide variety of compliance programs that validate our security controls
Click here to learn more about our compliance programs.
We protect the security of your information during transmission to or from AWS websites, applications, products, or services by using encryption protocols and software.
We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal information
Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.

If you cannot access or update your information yourself, you can always contact us for assistance.
You have choices about the collection and use of your personal information
Many AWS Offerings include settings that provide you with options as to how your information is being used
You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of certain AWS Offerings.
Account Information: If you want to add, update, or delete information related to your account, please go to the AWS Management Console
When you update or delete any information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
Communications: If you do not want to receive promotional messages from us, please unsubscribe or adjust your communication preferences in the AWS Management Console or the AWS Email Preference Center
If you do not want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or your device.
Advertising: If you don’t want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.
Browser and Devices: The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Sellers and Amazon Partners: Sellers and Amazon Partner Network members can add, update, or delete information in the AWS Marketplace and APN Partner Central, respectively.
Children’s Personal Information
We don’t provide AWS Offerings for purchase by children
If you’re under 18, you may use AWS Offerings only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
Retention of Personal Information
We keep your personal information to enable your continued use of AWS Offerings, for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required by law (including for tax and accounting purposes), or as otherwise communicated to you
How long we retain specific personal information varies depending on the purpose for its use, and we will delete your personal information in accordance with applicable law.

You should check our website frequently to see recent changes
You can see the date on which the latest version of this Privacy Notice was posted
Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all personal information we have about you and your account
We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past without informing affected customers and giving them a choice.
