Cookies
List of cookies that we set and why
CEPR uses Cookies in order to:
Assist in controlling access to the CEPR website and its resources where applicable– e.g
eBooks
Improve the user experience on the website e.g
save log in information to avoid you having to log in and out
Provide information to Google Analytics for website use statistics
The sections below set out to explain what Cookies are together with how and why CEPR use them
We list all the cookies that are set on the CEPR website and what information we store in them.
Please refer to our Privacy Policy if you want further details on how we use your personal information
This policy may change from time, but if you are accessing this statement from the current version of our website, you are reading the latest version.If you have any questions about our use of Cookies, please email itsupport@cepr.org
What are Cookies?
When you visit a website with your mobile or desktop/laptop, you use a Web Browser to render the page and display data on the screen so that you can view and interact with it
Web Browsers are capable of storing small data files, ‘Cookies’, that can hold a variety of information
Just about all modern websites use Cookies in order to provide a better browsing experience.
If the website you are visiting sets the Cookie, it is called a ‘first party cookie’
The domain is listed when you inspect Cookies and only the host domain that is listed has access to the information in that Cookie
When you see the domain ‘.cepr.org’ or ‘cepr.org, it is only CEPR (as we own this domain) that has access to the data held in the Cookie.
‘Third party Cookies’, as the name implies, are those set by Third Party service providers e.g
Twitter
Again, if you look at the host domain, it will tell you who set it and who has access to it
All Cookies are used to record data about the browsing experience and journey.
Some Cookies are essential to the basic operation of a modern web site
A good example on the CEPR site is ‘PHPSESSID’
CEPR sites use the Drupal framework to create the site and Drupal is written in a language called PHP
The Cookie labelled PHPSESSID stores essential ‘Session’ data used by PHP to manage interaction with the site.
Do I have to accept control cookies? Can I control them?
Every person has the right to use the settings in their browser to control Cookies, as well as express your preferences with third party services
It is therefore possible to accept or reject cookies
Before doing so, please be sure you understand the impact in respect of your use of the CEPR website.
If you are concerned about advertising and the CEPR website, please do not be
We are a non-profit organisation that does not use Cookie data to target advertisements.
There are other organisations that help you make informed choices about things like targeted advertising and help you ‘opt out’
Here are a couple of links that you might be interested in exploring, including links to tools for opting out of advertising.

rules surrounding sending ‘spam’ emails) , we use a reputable third party ‘Bulk Email’ supplier, MailChimp
To manage our email lists and ensure they are compliant with GDPR and general 'Anti Spam' regulations worldwide, we track, through MailChimp, the opening of these email through the use of a tracking technology called ‘Web Beacons’
These beacons are tiny graphic images (‘gifs’) and when they are downloaded, they tell us whether the email has been opened, along with other information like the whether the email was forwarded to a friend using a special link we put in the email.If the automated downloaded of images is not set on the email client, we do not receive this information.
