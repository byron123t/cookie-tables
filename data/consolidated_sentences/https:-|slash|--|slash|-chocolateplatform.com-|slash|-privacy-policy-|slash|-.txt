LEGAL BASIS RELIED ON FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INDIVIDUALS
Chocolate is a data processor with respect to personal data collected or received by us when we receive such information from our publisher clients (the data controllers) that make their data available for use via our Services
Where we operate as a data processor, we are processing the data on behalf of our clients (the data controller(s) of the data) based on their instructions, and it is the responsibility of the data controller to establish an appropriate legal basis for the processing of the data
For example, we may process data when the individual has consented to such processing
On certain occasions we may rely on legitimate interest as a basis for processing, when it is in our clients’ and our legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights
Those legitimate interests include performing our obligations with respect to providing the Services and improving our Services.
