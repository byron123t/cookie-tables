RightsWhat does this mean?1
The right to be informed
You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights
This is why we are providing you with the information in this privacy statement.2
The right of accessYou have the right to obtain access to your information (if we are processing it), and other certain other information (similar to that provided in this privacy statement).
This is so you are aware and can check that we are using your information in accordance with data protection law.3
The right to rectificationYou are entitled to have your information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.4
The right to erasureThis is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it
This is not a general right to erasure
there are exceptions.5
The right to restrict processingYou have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information
When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further
We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.6
The right to data portabilityYou have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services
Eg, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between one provider’s IT systems and another’s safely and securely, without affecting its usability
However, we consider this right would only have very limited application in respect of the type of data that we would typically hold.7
The right to objectYou have the right to object to certain types of processing that is based on legitimate interests
Where you object, we may continue to process your information where we can show compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your rights and interests or where we need to use your information to bring or defend legal claims.
However, if you object to direct marketing, we will stop this as soon as possible (although there may sometimes be a short delay while your request is processed).
