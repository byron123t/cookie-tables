What is Do Not Track (DNT)?DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard
While some progress has been made, it has been slow
No standard has been adopted to this date.What to do if you don't want cookies to be set or want them to be removed?If you don't like the idea of cookies or certain types of cookies, you can change your browser's settings to delete cookies that have already been set and to not accept new cookies
