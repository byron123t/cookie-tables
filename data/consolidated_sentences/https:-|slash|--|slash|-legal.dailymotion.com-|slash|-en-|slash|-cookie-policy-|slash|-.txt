Cookie Policy
Last Update: October 12th, 2022
Dailymotion uses cookies to operate the Dailymotion Service, whether accessed directly from the Dailymotion website, the Dailymotion application, or through the Dailymotion’s video player embedded on third-party websites or applications
We do so either directly (using our own tracking technology
so called “first-party cookies”) or through our service providers (using the tracking technologies of services providers we contract with
so called “third-party cookies”)
Cookies are used regardless of the type of device or operating system the Dailymotion Service is accessed from.
This Cookie Policy contains information on:
the first-party and third-party cookies Dailymotion uses,the purposes Dailymotion uses them for,the way your consent is obtained in the territories where the use of cookies is dependent on it, andthe means that are made available to you to manage the use of these cookies.
Note that third parties who are not our service providers may also use cookies when you access the Dailymotion Service
Dailymotion does not control such third-party cookies and we invite you to consult these third-parties’ cookie policies to learn more about their use of cookies and cookie setting tools they make available to you.
I – What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored by a web server while you are browsing a website, placed on your device (e.g
your computer) and associated to a web domain
They allow collection or receipt of information about you, and in some cases, they store identifiers or other information on your device for future use
For example, when you visit a website, its editor may drop a cookie on your browser containing a unique user id
When you come back to that website, the existence of that cookie and the ID it contains allows the website to recognize you
If you access the same website using different browsers, you may have different cookies set on your device.
The word “cookies” is commonly used to include similar tracking technologies such as pixels, local storage or mobile IDs.
Note that cookies make it possible to collect data
However, not all data that they collect belongs to the category of “personal data”, meaning that some of that data is only technical and does not identify you individually.
When you access the Dailymotion Service, cookies can be either set by Dailymotion directly (first-party cookies) or by third parties (third-party cookies)
Third-party cookies are set on a different domain than the one you are visiting
They may be set either on our behalf (we are the ones controlling their use) or by third parties acting independently.
Some cookies are necessary to make a website operational
Without them, it is not possible to provide end-users with the services or videos they would like to access
These are referred to as “essential cookies” or “exempted cookies” as they are necessary to deliver a service or videos you expect to access and their use is exempted from your consent.
On the opposite, cookies that are not necessary to deliver a service or videos expected by an end-user are called “non-exempted cookies”
The non-exempted cookies are often further categorized based on their functionality (ex
analytics cookies, advertising cookies, etc.).
Some cookies are « session » cookies that only last for as long as the site is being visited, while other cookies can have a longer lifespan, which allow information obtained during one visit to be memorized until the next one.
You will find below detailed lists of cookies we use on the Dailymotion Service along with their purposes
All of these cookies have a lifespan not exceeding 13 months, regardless of the geographical availability of our Service.
Depending on the country from which you visit the Dailymotion Service, you may have the opportunity to decide which cookies can be set on your device (except the exempted cookies which do not require your consent) and manage your choices by accessing the Consent Management page, available on the Dailymotion Service
Note that since cookies are linked to a specific browser operating on a specific device, your cookie settings are applicable only to the browser and device used when defining your cookie setting on the Dailymotion Service
Therefore, if you use different devices or different browsers to access the Dailymotion Service, you should confirm your cookies settings separately for each device/browser combination you use.
II – Cookies Used by Dailymotion on the Dailymotion Service
1
Dailymotion Exempted Cookies on the Dailymotion Service
The Dailymotion Service is a video hosting platform where you can upload content and access videos free of charge that can be associated with advertisements
Note that both videos and ads form an integral part of the Dailymotion Service and their presence is an essential element of the service that we offer to you.
Note, that as part of the constant evolution of the Dailymotion Service, as of recently, Dailymotion offers the users of its proprietary media player, the possibility to install, on their digital properties, our video player that streams videos without associated advertising (“SaaS Video Player”)
In such case, the revenues traditionally generated by the advertising are replaced by a fee paid by such users
The absence of advertising within the SaaS Video Player results in the absence of advertising cookies
To access the list of cookies deployed within the SaaS Video Player, please refer to the table below.
Exempted cookies are necessary to provide the services reasonably expected from us by you and any other end-user accessing the Dailymotion Service (e.g
watching videos, sharing your own video content, etc.) and as such, their use does not rely on your consent
Such cookies are also commonly referred to as “Essential Cookies”.
When you access the Dailymotion Service to watch videos, we use Exempted Cookies in order for you to be able to:
enjoy videos without being overflooded with ads (we use an ad pressure cookie for that);watch videos in a language that you understand and have access to service features in the language in which you use your browser;access videos that their owners decided to make available in the country you are in (we check your IP address for that) and at the time you access our Service.
As is the case with all cookies, the actual cookies that you may see on your device’s browser depend on how or from where you use the Dailymotion Service (e.g
whether you visit our Service from the Dailymotion website or from a third-party website where our Video Player is embedded).
The cookies we use are deployed under the domains controlled by Dailymotion, namely “dailymotion.com” or “dmxleo.com”
Consequently, they are considered first-party cookies.
As of the last update of this Cookie Policy, we drop the following first-party Exempted Cookies:

Please note that when Dailymotion uses Exempted Cookies to store or otherwise process personal data that we collect, we act as a “Data Controller”
In such case, our processing of personal data is based on legitimate interest, legal obligation or contractuel obligation that we have towards you.

Non-Exempted Cookies on the Dailymotion Service
A
First Party Cookies and Third-Party Cookies Used by Dailymotion
In addition to Exempted Cookies, we use non-exempted cookies which are either directly set by Dailymotion (i.e
first-party cookies deployed under the domains “dailymotion.com” or dmxleo.com”) or through our service providers (i.e
third-party cookies), to optimize the Dailymotion Service
In the latter case, we use third-party tracking technologies for our own purposes
These third-party cookies are usually set under the domain of the service provider whose technology we use
However, in some cases, for technical reasons, we may integrate a third-party tracking technology within our system and deploy it on our own domain
For example, that is the case of analytics cookies provided by Google
They are deployed by us using the ‘dailymotion.com’ domain.
B
Purposes of Use of Personal Data Collected by Cookies
Deployment of non-exempted cookies is subject to your prior consent and personal data collected by them, if any, is used for various purposes, majority of which are named based on the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) standard purposes description.
The standard IAB purposes for which we use the cookies and/or the data they collect are as follows:
Store and/or access information on a deviceSelect basic adsCreate a personalised ads profileSelect personalised adsCreate a personalised content profileSelect personalised contentMeasure ad performanceMeasure content performanceApply market research to generate audience insightsDevelop and improve productsEnsure security, prevent fraud, and debugTechnically deliver ads or content
Additionally, we may use the personal data collected by cookies to allow you interaction via social media.
The list of purposes we process personal data for is available within the cookie banner and the “Manage Cookies” page.
C
Dailymotion Collection of Personal Data Through Non-Exempted Cookies
When Dailymotion uses its own first-party cookies to collect personal data for its own purposes, we act as a “Data Controller”
When we use third parties’ tracking technologies for our own purposes, we still act as a Data Controller and such third parties act as our Data Processors
In other words, it is Dailymotion who determines, in both cases, the purposes and the means of the personal data processing and instructs its third party Data Processors to provide their technical assistance in doing so.
We may also jointly decide with a third party to drop their cookie that will serve both our purposes and those of the third party
In such case, Dailymotion and third party are “Joint Data Controllers” for setting the cookie and using the collected information.
However, if the personal data collected by such third-party cookie is also used independently by that third party (in addition to the joint use), then for that further independent use of collected information, this third party is an “Independent Data Controller”
In this scenario, each party is separately responsible for its own independent use of the data collected by a cookie which deployment was a joint decision.
C
List of Non-Exempted Cookies
Below you will find a list of the main non-exempted cookies used by Dailymotion on the Dailymotion Service
This list includes first-party cookies (created on dailymotion.com or dmxleo.com domains) as well as the main third-party cookies of our service providers that we use (created on third-party domains or on Dailymotion’s domains)
Note that the list of our service providers may change over time:

Please note that when Dailymotion uses third-party cookies provided by our service providers to store personal data for our own legitimate purposes, we act as a “Data Controller”.
III – Cookies Used Independently by Third Parties
Note that when you access the Dailymotion Service, some third parties, acting independently from Dailymotion, may deploy third-party cookies on your device
These cookies are deployed under a domain different than ‘dailymotion.com’ or ‘dmxleo.com’ and their deployment is not controlled by us
When dropping such cookies, these third parties do not act as our service providers (unlike those described in Section II.2 above) and Dailymotion neither defines nor controls the purposes these cookies are used for.
Below you will find the main categories of third-party cookies that are likely to be dropped while you are using the Dailymotion Service
You may find an exhaustive list of third parties that may deploy such cookies on the “Manage Cookies” Section and learn more about them by consulting such third party’s privacy policies, as accessible from the links available within the “Manage Cookies” Section.
1
Third-Party Advertising Cookies
As it is commonly the case for non-public freely accessible websites, the gratuity of access to videos hosted on the Dailymotion Service is only possible thanks to the revenues generated by ads
Ads are an essential and non-dissociable part of the Dailymotion Service
A significant portion of the ad-generated revenue is shared with the owners or right holders of the videos that may be watched on the Dailymotion Service and consequently serves to finance creativity
The rest of these revenues is used to finance and improve the Dailymotion Service.
Companies participating in the delivery of ads (such as advertisers, advertising agencies, audience measurement companies, etc.) use cookies to deliver, adapt and measure the efficiency of advertising campaigns
Such cookies allow, for example, to record the number of views generated by a given ad displayed on the Dailymotion Service and its impact on the viewers (ex
whether an ad was clicked on or skipped)
Such information notably serves to calculate the revenues owed to the participants of the advertising distribution chain (the video owners, advertising agencies, publishers who embed our Video Player, etc.) or to establish statistics.
Additionally, when we are able to use a cookie identifier for a web browser, we will try to match it to other companies’ cookie identifiers
This is a common practice in the digital advertising industry, often called cookie syncing, and it enables, by recognizing a common end-user, the sharing and use of data between different companies that are involved in buying and selling digital ad space
In essence, it allows one company to send a digital ad request to another that says, “we have an opportunity to show an ad on dailymotion.com to a user you know as 0123456789”.
Advertising cookies are also used to gather and store information from you on your device to deduce your advertising profile (ex: your probable age range, gender, the subjects you are interested in, etc.) and consequently adapt the ads to your probable centers of interest (behavioral advertising).
Moreover, advertising cookies also serve to technically deliver ads, control the number of ads you see and avoid showing you the same ad too frequently (management of ad pressure).
2
Social Network Cookies (ex: Facebook, Twitter) and “Share” Feature Available on the Dailymotion Service
We have implemented a share feature to enable you to share videos you like with others on our Service
If you decide to use it, you may share the videos of your choice onto your social network accounts like Facebook and/or Twitter.
When you share videos on social networks, cookies are dropped by those social networks on your device
The social network cookie will likely allow social networks to identify you when you use the share feature and thereafter.
Additionally, the presence of a social network share feature can allow the social network in question to track your browsing behavior on the Dailymotion website or application, even if you did not use this feature during your visit on the Dailymotion Service
Indeed, this type of feature may allow the relevant social network to track your browsing on our Dailymotion Service, simply because your social network account was activated on your device (open session) during your visit of the Dailymotion Service, and consequently because social network cookies had already been present on your browser independently of your use of our Service.
We have no control over the process used by social networks to collect information about your browsing on the Dailymotion Service nor further information pertaining to their processing of your personal data in their possession
We invite you to consult the privacy policies of these social networks to learn about the purposes for which they use the browsing information (including advertising purposes) they may collect through these features.
IV – Consent Collection
When our use of cookies requires your consent, we ask for it using a feature commonly referred to as a “cookie banner” or “consent management platform”
Note that the purposes and the legal bases we rely on to process your personal data are the same, whether you visit our Service on the Dailymotion Properties, i.e
on our website (dailymotion.com) and our mobile applications, or through the Dailymotion Video Player embedded on third party digital properties
The present section IV provides you with detailed information on the consent management platform operational in the European Economic Area, UK or Switzerland.
1
Consent Collection on the Dailymotion Properties
When you visit the Dailymotion Properties (i.e
the Dailymotion website and our mobile applications), we inform you about the use of cookies and ask for your consent to use non-exempted ones
Additionally, we inform you about the purposes your personal data may be processed for, ask you to consent to it or, if we rely on legitimate interest, provide you with a possibility to oppose to it.
Our cookie banner implements the Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”) specifications developed by the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau)
Consequently, it records your privacy settings and provides you with data processing information on behalf of multiple controllers (i.e
Dailymotion and third parties referred to as “Partners” in the cookie banner and hereafter) by using IAB industry-standard purposes and descriptions
Some of the Partners that we collect consent for and provide information about are, like Dailymotion, members of the TCF
They are referred to as “TCF Partners” or “IAB Vendors”
Those of the Partners who are not members of the TCF are referred to as “Non-TCF Partners” or “Non-IAB Vendors”.
Our cookie banner informs you about the identity of the Partners, i.e
the identity of third-party Controllers  that might drop cookies and collect personal data on the Dailymotion Service
The cookie banner provides information about the purposes and legal bases they rely on and enables you to consent, refuse or oppose to their use of non-exempted cookies and consequent processing of personal data.
If you accept all cookies and associated purposes via our cookie banner, your consent applies to the use of cookies and related processing of your personal data undertaken by Dailymotion and all its Partners (i.e
both TCF Partners and non-TCF Partners).
Once you have made your privacy choices via the cookie banner, your decision is transferred by us to our TCF Partners, using this industry-standard format.
For TCF Partners, you may obtain further information about their use of cookies and processing of your data in the “Partners” tab of our consent management platform accessible either directly from the cookie banner of from the “Manage cookies” section of our website, Video Player or application.
To obtain such information about the Non-TCF Partners, please refer to their respective privacy policies following the links provided in the “Partner List”, a document accessible on our consent management platform under each processing purpose in its “Purposes” tab as well as at the bottom of the “Partners” tab.
2
Consent Collection when the Dailymotion Player is Embedded on Third-Party Properties
The Dailymotion Video Player can be embedded on third-party digital properties
When you visit a website, you may see the Video Player integrated directly withing this website’s interface
Note though that our Video Player is part of the Dailymotion Service and is independent from the website on which it is embedded.
Consequently, Dailymotion is responsible for informing the users of the Dailymotion Service, including the Video Player, and collecting their consent through a “cookie banner” integrated directly within the Video Player exported on third party digital properties.
However, when you visit such editors’ digital properties embedding the Dailymotion Player, you might see two cookie banners
One deployed by the publisher of this digital property and a second one deployed by us within our Player
In order to avoid the experience of a double collection of consent on the sites on which the Video Player is exported, Dailymotion has developed a solution called “Infopack”
The implementation and operation modalities of the Infopac are described below.
a) Consent Collection by Embedding Editors – the “Infopack” Solution
The “Infopack” solution is only made available to publishers of third party digital properties that have implemented a cookie banner (or pop-up) that is compliant with the IAB TCF specifications.
Such cookie banner notably lists all the TCF Partners for whom the publisher collects consent and provides relevant information for
For each of these TCF Partners, the publisher informs you about the purposes and the legal bases they rely on and enable you to consent, refuse or oppose to the corresponding processing
That information is provided by each TCF Partner directly to the IAB that centralizes it and renders it accessible to any publisher wishing to use a TCF-compliant consent management platform.
When a publisher lists Dailymotion among the TCF Partners it collects consent and provides information for, that publisher will collect consent (or record absence of such consent) for Dailymotion and pass your consent settings to us
As such, you will not be shown a separate  Dailymotion cookie banner within our Video Player
Instead, you will only see the publisher’s cookie banner and we will rely on the consent such editor has collected on our behalf and passed to us.
If you wish to consent to Dailymotion’s use of cookies and further processing of your personal data, you can either globally accept all cookies (and all TCF Partners) on the publisher’s cookie banner (typically by clicking on “Accept All”, “I agree” or other similar text) or decide to make more granular choices and consent specifically to Dailymotion’s use of cookies and processing of your personal data via the privacy settings of this publisher (typically by clicking on “Personalize” or “See Partners’ List”).
In any case, your privacy choices are transferred to us by the publisher using the IAB’s TCF standards
They apply to the use of cookies and the related personal data processing undertaken by the Video Player embedded on that publisher’s digital properties that a cookie banner you interacted with applies to.
b) Consent Collection by Dailymotion – Cookie Banner within the Video Player
It may happen that we cannot always rely on the publishers of these digital properties to collect consent for us
It is in particular the case of publishers that decided not to use the IAB TCF standards
In such event, we use our own cookie banner integrated directly within the Video Player to record your consent settings.
Our cookie banner integrated within the Video Player ensures the same goal as the one present on the Dailymotion website (as further explained in section  IV.1 of this Cookie Policy).
As we are unable to obtain from or share your consent with the digital property that integrates our Player, each, Dailymotion and that property, needs to ensure an independent consent collection mechanism
Consequently, two distinct cookie banners are shown to you
Your choices recorded through our in-Player cookie banner apply only to the use of cookies and processing of your personal data in relation with your use of the Dailymotion Service (including through the Video Player) and do not apply to any other use you may have of the digital property our Player is embedded on
If you wish to accept or refuse the use of cookies and processing of your personal data by the embedding digital property, you need to express your choices through that publisher’s cookie banner.
V – Accepting or Refusing Cookies
Depending on the country you visit the Dailymotion Service from, you may set your cookie preferences using one or more of the methods listed below.
1
Setting Cookie Preferences on the Dailymotion Service
a) Setting Cookie Preferences when Dailymotion does not rely on the Publisher’s Consent Management Mechanism
If you access the Dailymotion Service (i.e
the Dailymotion websites or application, as well as the embedded Dailymotion Video Player) from a country that is part of the European Economic Area, UK or Switzerland, our cookie banner allows you to exercise your right to:
consent to or refuse the use of non-exempted cookies, andconsent to or refuse the processing of personal data when such processing relies on your consent, andoppose to the processing of your personal data, when such processing relies on legitimate interest and there are no prevailing interests justifying continuation of such processing.
You may make different choices through the cookie banner:
By clicking the “Accept” button within the cookie banner, you accept the use of all cookies dropped by Dailymotion or its Partners (TCF and non-TCF Partners) and the processing of your personal data for all of the listed purposes.
By clicking the “Personalize” button, you will be redirected to our “Consent Management” page with more detailed  information and a list of the Partners that may use cookies and collect personal data on the Dailymotion Service
The Consent Management page enables you to  either accept or refuse to grant consent for all listed purposes and all listed Partners or make granular choices
It means that you may choose to either allow or refuse processing for all purposes or allow processing for certain purposes and/or by certain Partners while refusing the others
If you want to personalize your privacy settings, you may do so on a purpose-by-purpose basis and, for TCF Partners only, on a partner-by-partner basis
You may also oppose to the processing purposes which rely on legitimate interest, by ticking the “Opt out” box below each purpose
Your choices expressed on a purpose-by-purpose basis apply to all Partners (both TCF and non-TCF Partners)
Your choices expressed on a partner-by-partner basis apply only to the TCF Partners that you have selected.
By clicking on “Continue without accepting”, the banner will disappear, and we will not set any non-exempted cookies on your device.
As a reminder, you cannot refuse exempted cookies which are necessary for the Dailymotion Service to operate, as mentioned in Section II.1
Consequently, you will see exempted cookies on your browser regardless of the privacy settings you make
Note also that your refusal prevents deployment of new cookies but does not delete the already existing ones
They will no longer be used but they will remain on your device until you delete them or they reach their expiry date.
You may change your privacy preferences at any time via the Consent Management page accessible at all times from the footer of the Dailymotion Service through the “Manage Cookies” link or within the settings of our applications or our Video Player embedded on third party websites.
Please note that depending on the country you visit us from, the options listed above might not be available to you
In such case, we advise you to refer to the procedures described in Sections V.2 and V.3
below to set your cookies preferences.
b) Setting Cookie Preferences when Dailymotion Relies on the Publisher’s Consent Management Mechanism
When our Video Player is embedded on third party digital properties, as explained in section IV.2.a., in the EEA countries, UK or Switzerland, it is usually the publisher of such property that informs you about the use of cookies and personal data, and that asks for your consent, including on behalf of their partners, such as Dailymotion.
When Dailymotion relies on the publisher for obtaining your consent,  it is that publisher’s own consent collection mechanism that allows you to:
consent to or refuse our use of non-exempted cookies, andconsent to or refuse our processing of your personal data when such processing relies on your consent, andoppose to our processing of your personal data when such processing relies on legitimate interest and there are no prevailing interests justifying continuation of such processing.
If you consent to the use of cookies and processing of your personal data, the publisher will inform us about your choice and Dailymotion will set the non-exempted cookies and process your personal data accordingly.
In the absence of your consent, the publisher will also inform us about your choice, and we will refrain from using non-exempted cookies and limit processing of your personal data accordingly.
As a reminder, you cannot refuse exempted cookies which are necessary for our Service to operate
Consequently, you will continue to see Dailymotion’s exempted cookies on your browser regardless of the privacy settings you make
You will also continue to see cookies that might have been deployed before your refusal
They will no longer be used by us but they will remain on your device until you delete them or they reach their expiry date.
Note that you may change your privacy preferences at any time through the publisher’s own consent management tool.
2
Setting Cookie Preferences outside of the Dailymotion Service
If you reside outside of the UK, Switzerland and the EEA or if you wish to use other methods than those described above, the following cookie preferences options are available to you.
a) Setting Cookie Preferences using your Browser Features
All browsers have features allowing you to:
get information about the cookies saved on your device
accept or refuse them, either on a case-by-case basis or outright.
The configuration of each browser is different
We suggest you consult the help menu of your browser to learn how to personalize its cookie settings
If you accept cookies within your browser settings, cookies will be integrated into the pages and content you have viewed and may be temporarily stored in a dedicated location on your device.
Refusing cookies can be achieved through different browser settings
Depending on the settings used such refusal may impact the functioning of the Dailymotion Service you wish to access.
How to manage and/or delete cookies according to the browser you use?
At any time, you may view the cookie management settings used by your browser, and delete any cookies it has stored, which must be done one by one
To make your search easier, please find below a list of direct links for each of the main browsers in use:
Google ChromeTM Firefox TM EdgeTM Safari TM Opéra TM
You may also access this website for a very detailed step-by-step process on how to disable cookies from each of the main browsers, as listed above.
Similarly, the French data protection authority – CNIL – provides on its website information about cookies and describes several options for setting and deleting cookies stored on your device (in French only).
Note that configurations are different on your cell phone or tablet:
iOS TM Android TM Windows TM
How to prevent tracking via the ‘Do Not Track’ option?
You may configure the browser on your device to send a signal informing websites that you do not wish to be tracked
This option is often called “Do Not Track” and can be accessed at the following links for the main browsers listed below:
Edge ™Chrome ™ Firefox ™ Safari TM
However, we draw your attention to the fact that we cannot guarantee that this choice will always be acted on by companies receiving it
Therefore, on its own, this option does not represent an efficient solution for refusing all cookies.
b) Setting Cookie Preferences through Professional Platforms
The European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), a group of advertising professionals, has developed a tool allowing you to accept or refuse cookies used by companies participating in that EDAA initiative
Note that this initiative is designed for the advertising sector only
Companies that do not participate in it will not receive any information about your decision regarding cookies and consequently may continue to use them
Therefore, acted on its own, this option does not represent an efficient solution for refusing all cookies
To consult the list of participants and set your choices, please visit the EDAA platform available at http://www.youronlinechoices.com.
