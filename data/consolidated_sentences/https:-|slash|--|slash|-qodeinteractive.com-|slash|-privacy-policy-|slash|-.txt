Privacy Policy
Qode Interactive
This Privacy Policy is brought by QODE LTD, incorporated and existing under the laws of Cyprus (hereinafter: QODE)
QODE is the sole owner of a number of websites and platforms, including, but not limited to qodeinteractive.com, qodethemes.com, elated-themes.com, select-themes.com, edge-themes.com, mikado-themes.com, and a number of demo websites containing previews of WordPress website themes developed by QODE
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy the term “Platform” shall refer collectively to all websites and platforms owned by QODE and all their content, themes, codes, etc
This Privacy Policy shall apply to all QODE Platforms where this Privacy Policy is featured
This Privacy Policy describes how the QODE collects, uses, shares and secures personal information that you provide.
What kind of information do we collect?
To provide you with all information regarding our products and services, we must process certain information about you
The type of information we collect starts with you signing up for an account on the Platform, giving necessary information for opening of your account, such as your name, country of residence and email
We also collect the information regarding your IP address, log data and purchase code, as well as the information provided by cookies
You can learn how to access and delete information we collect upon request.
Things that you provide
Information and content, you provide: We ask for and you provide us the necessary basic information about you when you sign up for an account on our Platform
The necessary data is requested in order to create your personal account that enables you to use all functionalities of the Platform, including but not limited to purchase of WordPress website themes (“Themes”) and ordering and obtaining of support services (“Services”)
This information includes: your name and surname, country of residence, email address, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name, when you register for an account as legal entity
We refer to any information described above as ‘’Account Information’’ for the purpose of this Policy
By voluntarily providing us with Account Information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal information or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us
Your Account Information is not publicly available and we do not publish on Platform any information provided by you, except the user name you have chosen when opening your account.
We may ask for and collect other personal information from you for other purposes such as: customer support, promotions, newsletter, collecting CVs and information contained therein on our career page
When submitting comments to the Platform you may also be required to provide some personal information (provided that you do not already have user account that you will use for commenting)
Also, when you communicate with us directly (for example when we provide Support), we may ask for additional personal information if such information is necessary for performance of a particular task.
Please note that certain information (such as racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation or philosophical beliefs) may be treated as sensitive data and could be subject to special protections under the laws of your country
Generally, we do not collect any sensitive data and in event that collection of such data is required you will be properly informed.
Log data and Cookies
Like many operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Platform, further referred to as ‘’Log data’’
This Log data may include, among others, information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol ‘’IP’’ address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Platform that you visit, the time and date that you visit, the time spent on those pages and information you search for
We connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve our Platform.
Our Platform also collects data from cookies stored on your device (including cookie IDs and settings) and the data obtained this way may differentiate depending whether you are logged in to your account
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit
They are commonly used across the internet in order to make websites work, improve their personalisation, or to provide information to the owners of the site about how it is working
A cookie often contains a unique identifier, which can be used to recognise your computer when it returns to a website that it has visited before.
Pixels work with cookies to help us understand how you use our website and to improve our advertising, similar to cookies
Pixels are different from cookies because they do not stay on your computer, they are temporary while you browse our Site and are ‘removed’ when you close our Site.
Cookies are commonly classified into ‘first party’ and ‘third party’ cookies, and this changes whether we or one of our partners serves you the cookie
First party cookies are served by us and are more likely used to ensure performance of our Site, while third party cookies are hosted by one of our partners and more likely used for analytics and measurement of marketing performance.
Cookies may also have different lifetimes – this means that they stay on your computer for a defined period before being automatically removed
Another common cookie type is a ‘session cookie’, these cookies are automatically removed when you close your browser.
What information about you we receive from others?
In some situations, we need to obtain some information about you from third parties to whom you have provided certain information about yourself
This information is necessary for your uninterrupted use of the Platform’s functionalities.
When you use the Platform for purchase of the Themes and/or Services, we need to receive financial and/or transaction details from payment providers with whom you have made such payment
As we are the receiving party for such financial transaction, we need to have this information so we can be properly informed about the payment and provide you with purchased Themes and/or Services.
We also may receive information from other third-party sources, whereby we receive additional information about you (to the extent permitted by applicable law), such as fraud detection information, and combine it with information we have about you
Such data may be necessary to prevent frauds and secure safe and uninterrupted use of the Platform.
What kind of information may others collect when you are using the platform?
When using the Platform, you may be linked to third-party services that will collect certain personal information from you
This information is not collected or used by us and it is a subject to privacy policies of such third parties.
Payment Services
When using the Platform for purchasing of Themes and/or Services, you will be redirected to third-party websites or platforms for completing the financial transaction
These websites and platforms will request certain information from you (including your credit card information) in order to carry out the payment
As we are the receiving party to this financial transaction, we will receive information about the transaction from third-party payment providers.
Embedded content
The Platform may include embedded content (e.g
images, videos, articles, etc.) from third-party websites (such as YouTube, Vimeo, Google Web Fonts, SoundCloud, etc.)
Accessing this embedded content makes the same effect as you are accessing third-party websites from which embedded content is provided
These third-party websites, therefore, may collect certain information about you in accordance with their own privacy policy
Please note that if you have an account on such third-party website and you are logged-in while accessing embedded content, such accessing will be attributed to your account
For example, interactions that you may make with embedded content will be traced by third-party website and the same may influence the user experience that you will have on such website.

When necessary we conduct the identity check of the users within the comment section in order to prevent the abuse of the comments and reviews.
Verification of Services

Whenever we do transfer your personal information to third parties or services providers, appropriate arrangements are made in order to ensure correct and secure data processing in compliance with law.
We may share some collected information with our third–party service providers that we use to provide hosting for maintenance of our Platform, backup, storage, analytics, payment services and other services
These third-party service providers may have the access to or may process your personal information for the purpose of providing these services for us
We do not permit our third-party service providers to use the personal information that we share with them for their marketing purposes or any other purpose not in connection with the services they provide to us.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information to the authorities, due to the court orders, legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, and we might share such an information in order to prevent any illegal activity, suspected fraud, or any type of violation of personal or other rights.
How can I manage or delete information about me?
If you wish to access or erase your data, you can contact us via office@qodeinteractive.com in order to give you the detailed instructions regarding this matter.
We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services within Platform, for example you Account will be active in order to provide you with our support, unless you request your account to be deleted
This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs
Your data related to the purchase record will be deleted upon each purchase or 2 years at latest.
When you delete your account, we may delete any content you have provided, and you will not be able to recover that information later.
How do we operate and transfer data as part of our Global Services?
We may share information globally, within QODE and our third-party service providers in accordance with this Policy
Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy
These data transfers may be necessary to provide the services set forth in Terms of Use of the Platform in order to provide our products and services to you
We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers in accordance with applicable law.
How will we notify you of changes to this policy?
