Cookie Policy
Last Updated: November 25, 2019
WHAT ARE COOKIES
Cookies are small files, containing numbers and letters that are stored on your devices by websites that you visit
Cookies allow websites to recognize you and make your next visit easier and more useful
Used alone, cookies do not personally identify you, but recognize your web browser.
There are different types and uses of cookies
Some cookies are strictly necessary for the website to function, while others may be used for performance, functionality, and advertising purposes
Most websites you visit use cookies to improve your user experience by allowing the website to remember you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’)
Such cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first-party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third-party cookies’).
In most instances, however, cookies are used to provide you with a smooth and functional experience
You can always disable the use of cookies by configuring your browser’s privacy settings (refer to your browser’s settings to learn more about cookie controls)
Please note that if you choose to disable the use of cookies entirely, many websites, including the Sectigo website, will not function properly
For example, if a website does not use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site
This means that even after you “log in,” if you navigate to another page, the website will not recognize you and it will not be able to keep you logged in.
HOW WE USE COOKIES
When you use and access the Sectigo websites, we may place a number of cookie files on your web browser
We use cookies on our website to improve your website experiences, assist in your navigation and ability to provide feedback, to analyze trends relating to your use of our products and services, to remember your preferences or settings, to assist with our promotional and marketing efforts and to provide content from third parties
Cookies help us understand how our website is being used and improve your user experience.
