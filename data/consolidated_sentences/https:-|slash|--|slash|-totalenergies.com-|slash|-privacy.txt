Summarized version of TotalEnergies' Binding Corporate Rules
1
Introduction
The TotalEnergies Group (or “Total”) promotes a culture and practices regarding the protection of personal data1, in accordance with the applicable laws
To this end, TotalEnergies has implemented Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”).
This document summarizes the data protection principles that apply under our BCRs and the rights granted by them.
2
Purpose
Our BCRs are a set of internal binding rules, which are applicable to all of the TotalEnergies subsidiaries that have adopted them
They have been approved by the European data protection authorities.
They allow TotalEnergies subsidiaries to transfer personal data originating from the European economic area (“EEA”)2 to TotalEnergies subsidiaries located outside of the EEA in compliance with the applicable law.
3
Implementation scope
Our BCRs apply to all EEA-originating personal data processed by TotalEnergies subsidiaries including data relating to former and current employees, job applicants, clients and prospective clients, suppliers and sub-contractors and the staff of third companies acting on behalf of the Group subsidiaries as well as shareholders (hereafter “data subjects”).
4
Protection principles
The following principles set out in our BCRs must be respected, among which:
Lawfulness
Any processing3 operation carried out has a legal basis, provided by the applicable law.
Personal data must only be processed for lawful, determined and legitimate purposes
The data must not be further processed in a way which is incompatible with those purposes.
Relevance
Personal data must be accurate and proportionate, in terms of quality and quantity, in relation to the purpose of the processing.
Transparency
Personal data must be obtained lawfully and loyally
Data subjects must be informed about the characteristics of the processing of their personal data and about their rights, unless this proves impossible or would involve disproportionate efforts.
Security
Personal data must be protected by appropriate security measures to limit the risks of unauthorized access, destruction, alteration or loss.
To do so, a set of internal norms apply, allowing to ensure the security and the confidentiality of personal data:
The usage Charter for the IT and communication resources, that requires to act in accordance with the regulation and with the confidentiality rules;
The Information Systems Security policy, that defines the governance mode of the security of information systems;
The Information Systems Security Reference System, that enumerates, through 19 detailed themes, the different requirements of the Group in terms of security of information systems;
The Information Protection policy, that presents the requirements relative to the protection of confidentiality, integrity and of the availability of the information held and exchanged within the Group
When calling upon the services of a third party to process personal data, TotalEnergies subsidiary makes sure that the latter offers sufficient guarantees as regards the security and confidentiality of data.
Retention
Personal data must be retained only for a reasonable and not excessive period of time with regard to the purpose of the processing.
When the retention period expires, the data is destroyed, anonymized or archived.
International transfers4 of personal data
TotalEnergies does not transfer personal data originating from a country of the EEA directly to a TotalEnergies subsidiary located in a third country which does not provide an adequate level of protection, unless such subsidiary has formally subscribed to the BCRs or uses another legal instrument recognized by the European Commission.
TotalEnergies does not transfer personal data originating from the EEA directly to a company not belonging to the Group located in a country which does not provide an adequate level of data protection (data controller or processor) without a legal basis under applicable law and instruments providing for sufficient safeguards, such as the standard contractual clauses.
Similarly, where a data importer further transfers personal data originating from the EEA to a company not belonging to the Group (data controller or processor) located in a country which does not provide an adequate level of data protection, the data importer shall enter into an agreement with this company whereby it commits to observe the principles of BCRs.
5
Data subject rights
Under our BCRs, data subjects whose personal data are processed have the following rights:
Right of access to the data
Right to rectify, erase and lock data
Right to object to the processing
Right to limit the processing
[A comprehensive list of the rights granted by the BCRs is detailed in APPENDIX 1 hereafter].
Data subjects may exercise these rights by submitting a request using the contact details provided in the legal notice concerning the processing of their data
TotalEnergies subsidiaries undertake to give replies within the legal deadline about queries concerning the processing outside the EEA.
Moreover, if data subjects believe that a TotalEnergies subsidiary has failed to observe the BCRs, they have the right to lodge a complaint by sending:
An e-mail to: data-protection@totalenergies.com
or
A letter to TotalEnergies – DATA PROTECTION, Tour Coupole, 2 place Jean Millier, Arche Nord Coupole/Regnault, 92078 PARIS LA DEFENSE CEDEX.
Data subjects will be informed about the status of their complaint and of any further steps.
The internal complaint procedure is described in APPENDIX 2 hereafter.
The fact that data subjects may file a complaint with TotalEnergies does not affect their rights to lodge a complaint with the competent EEA data protection authorities or to bring an action before the courts of the EEA country where the TotalEnergies subsidiary responsible for exporting the personal data is established.
6
Governance
An internal « personal data Protection network » is in charge of monitoring and controlling the implementation of the BCRs within the Group
It is composed of:
A Corporate Data Privacy Lead who monitors and follows compliance actions at the Group level;
Branch Data Privacy Leads who lead and coordinate compliance actions at the Branch level;
Data Privacy Liaisons who lead and coordinate compliance actions at the affiliate level.
7
Internal control and audit
To ensure the proper application of our BCRs, some internal control and audit mechanisms have been implemented.
An annual internal control plan is defined by the personal data Protection network to assess the level of compliance of the Group’s processing regarding our BCRs
A reporting is also set up to report regularly on the actions plans that have been drawn up after evaluations.
Furthermore, the Group Internal Audit Direction also integrates the control of the personal data protection pattern into its periodic audit plan.
8
Changes to Total’s rules
If necessary, our BCRs may be completed or updated.
9
