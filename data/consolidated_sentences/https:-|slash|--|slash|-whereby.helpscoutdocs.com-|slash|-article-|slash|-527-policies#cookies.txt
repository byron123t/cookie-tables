Fair Use
This policy governs use of all Whereby plans as listed on our pricing page, and is a supplement to our Terms of Service
In order to provide affordable video meetings to as many users as possible, we require users to comply with this policy to prevent excessive or abusive usage that may result in unreasonable costs for us as a company and/or service degradation for other users
We have prepared this Fair Use Policy ("Policy") as a guide for our users to understand the intended and permissible uses of our service, and to prevent exploitation, fraud, and abuse of our unlimited usage plans.
How can I use Whereby?
Whereby is intended for normal, legitimate business use
This means use for video meetings during business hours (in the room owner’s time zone).
What is considered “Fair use”?
We may benchmark usage patterns of customers on different plan types to understand what levels of usage are normal by typical customers on the plan, and may use this to identify Users or Customers who have abnormal usage patterns.
Whereby may determine that abnormal, unreasonable or impermissible usage is occurring, and may take appropriate steps, including suspension or termination of service, even if the number of minutes used is not excessive, when a customer's calling patterns during more than one month reflect excessive:
volume of meetings
visitors to a room
meeting lengths;
uninterrupted meeting recordings;
excessive recorded meeting length;
meetings outside of normal business hours;
other calling patterns indicative of an attempt to evade enforcement of this Fair Use Policy
Explicitly, “Large Size” meeting rooms may not be used for security monitoring or continuously running telepresence.
Consequences of breach
Unauthorized or excessive use beyond that normally experienced by business customers may result in immediate account or plan termination with no refund.
Refunds
Our team works hard to make sure you have a service that fits you well
We work with refund requests on a case by case basis
However, all invoices older than 90 days will be deemed correct and ineligible for refund consideration.
Past Due Accounts
Accounts that are 45 days past due will be automatically cancelled and downgraded
In this case, some rooms may be removed from your account at that time.
