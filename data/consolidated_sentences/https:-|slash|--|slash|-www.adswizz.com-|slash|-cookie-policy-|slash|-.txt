Why only 48 hours?
Internet Service Providers, like your broadband or cellular operator, frequently change the IP addresses they lease to their subscribers
This means that the IP address you are being leased for today could be assigned to a totally different person next day.
A DHCP-assigned IP address is not permanent and expires in about 24 hours
We have chosen to persist the opt-out preference to an IP address for 48 hours, trying to favor your privacy preference but also being careful of false-positive mitigation across other users.
