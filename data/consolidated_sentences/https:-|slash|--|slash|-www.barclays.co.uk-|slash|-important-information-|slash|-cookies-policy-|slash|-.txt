Cookie policy
We use cookies and similar technologies on this website and on our mobile applications.
This website uses cookies and similar technologies to collect data from your device
Like many banks, we need to collect this data for the website to operate, but we also use it to provide the best experience, understand how you use our website, provide social media features, personalise content, deliver service messages and deliver adverts.
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which your computer or mobile device downloads when you visit a website
When you return to websites – or visit websites that use the same cookies – they recognise these cookies and therefore your browsing device.
We use cookies to do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience
They can also help ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests
We also use similar technologies such as pixel tags and JavaScript to undertake these tasks.
If you visit our website, we will deploy these technologies to provide an online service more suited to the device you connect from, as well as to prevent and detect fraud, keeping you secure
When you visit our website from any device (mobile, tablet or PC), we collect information about your use of this site, such as information about the device or browser you use to access the site (including device type, operating system, screen resolution and more), the way you interact with this site, and the IP address your device connects from
You may not be able to initiate or complete some activities within our secure online services unless these cookies or similar technologies are installed
Please note, we may not be able to process certain transactions if you are physically located in certain countries.
We use cookies to

and
We use both our own (first-party) and partner companies' (third-party) cookies to support these activities
The types of cookies used on this website fall into one of four categories – strictly necessary, performance, functionality and profile and targeting.
Strictly necessary
The data collected in this category is essential to provide our services to you
The data is necessary for the website to operate, to verify your identity and to maintain your security and privacy while using the website
It enables you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas
This category is always on, as without this data, the services you’ve asked for can’t be provided
Although it is possible to disable cookies on websites via the browser settings, this would affect the functionality of the website, causing it not to work
This data is not used for marketing purposes or for the purposes covered by the other three categories below.
Performance
In most cases, the data collected in this category is anonymous and is used to inform us how the website is used, for example which areas you use most often and if you receive any error messages
With this data we can then improve how our website works and be sure that the products and services we offer are right for you and other people.
In limited cases for mobile banking issues, the information also enables us to identify specific issues you may have had.
This data is not used to target you with online advertising
Without this data, we can't assess how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your banking experience.
Functionality and profile
Data collected in this category enables the website to remember choices you make
This means a more personalised experience for features of the website that can be customised
It may also be used to provide services you've asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.
The data may also be used to ensure that our banking services and communications are relevant to you
This category can’t track your activity on other websites
Without this data, the website can’t remember choices you've previously made or personalise your experience in the website.
Targeting
Data collected in this category is used to help make our messages more relevant to you
The data is shared with other Barclays systems or with third parties, such as advertisers and social media platforms we may use to deliver personalised advertisements and messages
If you don't wish to consent to this category, it's important to note that you may still receive generic advertising or service messages, but they will be less relevant to you.
Cookies in emails
In addition to the cookies we use on this website, we also use cookies and similar technologies in some emails and push notifications
These help us to understand whether you have opened the email and how you have interacted with it
If you have enabled images, cookies may be set on your computer or mobile device
Cookies will also be set if you click on any link within the email.
Setting your data preferences
You can control how non-essential categories of cookies are placed on your device using the Data preferences page.
Check preferences
What happens to data collected by cookies that have been downloaded in the past?
If you'd initially consented to one or more categories, we may still use the data collected at that time, when you had previously provided your consent
When you change your settings to disable any of the non-essential categories, we will re-set our systems as soon as reasonably possible to stop using those categories to gather any further data.
