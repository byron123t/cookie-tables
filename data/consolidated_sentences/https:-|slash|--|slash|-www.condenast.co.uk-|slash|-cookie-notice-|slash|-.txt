Why do we use them?
Opting out of cookies
What are cookies?
Cookies and similar tracking technologies, such as tags, scripts and beacons, are small pieces of code (referred to
as cookies hereafter) that are stored on a device (computer, mobile phone, tablet etc) and enable a website to
"personalise" itself to users by remembering information about the user's visit to the website
We also use cookies
within emails we may send.
Cookies are used to collect information, where available, about your device, your IP address, operating system and
browser type and how you have interacted with our websites.
Why do we use them?
Our websites use cookies to:
Store any preferences you have made and display content to you in a more personalised way
Evaluate our websites' advertising and promotional effectiveness
Gain insight into the nature of our audience so we can tailor our content accordingly
Provide interest-based advertising on our websites and on other websites which are tailored to your interests
and preferences
Obtain information about how visitors interact with our content, and to help us improve the experience when
visiting our websites.
We advertise on our site and in our newsletters to help keep the content free for our audiences.
We will always make sure our websites contain clear and easy to find information about our cookies,
and you can find more information about the purposes for which we use cookies below.
What types of cookies do we use?
Session cookies - We only use these while you are visiting our website and they are deleted when you leave.
They remember you as you move between pages, for example recording the items you add to an online shopping
basket
They also help maintain security.
Persistent cookies - These cookies stay on your computer until they expire or are deleted
We set automatic
deletion dates so that we don't keep your information for longer than we need to.
First and third-party cookies – Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the website or domain
placing the cookie
First party cookies in basic terms are cookies set by a website visited by the user - the
website displayed in the URL window
Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one
being visited by the user
If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website
this would be a third-party cookie.
