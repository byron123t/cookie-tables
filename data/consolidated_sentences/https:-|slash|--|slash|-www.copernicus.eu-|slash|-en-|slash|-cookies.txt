What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site.
First party cookies are cookies set by the website you’re visiting
Only that website can read them
In addition, a website might potentially use external services, which also set their own cookies, known as third-party cookies.
Persistent cookies are cookies saved on your computer and that are not deleted automatically when you quit your browser, unlike a session cookie, which is deleted when you quit your browser.
Every time you visit the Copernicus website, you will be invited to accept or refuse cookies
You also have the option to give your preferences regarding the use and type of cookies stored in your browser for a certain period of time
That way you don’t have to re-enter them when browsing around the site during the same visit.
Cookies can also be used to establish anonymised statistics about the browsing experience on our site.
Some of our pages display content from external providers, e.g
YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter
To view this third-party content, you first have to accept their specific terms and conditions
This includes their cookie policies, which we have no control over
But if you do not view this content, no third-party cookies are installed on your device
These third-party services are outside of the control of the Commission
Providers may, at any time, change their terms of service, purpose and use of cookies, etc.
In order to view such third-party content on our websites, a message will alert you that you need to accept those third parties’ specific terms and conditions, including their cookie policies, over which the Commission has no control
In the event that one or more third party IT tools are occasionally unavailable, we accept no responsibility for lack of service due to their downtime.
We recommend that users read the relevant privacy policies of Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook.

In the event that one or more third party IT tools are occasionally unavailable, we accept no responsibility for lack of service due to their downtime.
Copernicus website uses Matomo Analytics
Matomo Analytics is a web analytics service self-hosted by the Copernicus website contractor
Its purpose is to analyse the traffic on our website
We use the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites.
The IP addresses of visitors are anonymised by the Copernicus website prior to their storage in the Matomo self-hosted database
this protects the anonymity of the visitors that have opted for the full website functionalities
Consequently, such data is stored on the website’s contractor servers located in the European Union.
The self-hosted version of Matomo Analytics has a retention control feature
This feature provides website owners with the flexibility to define a retention period for the data stored within the database.
Copernicus has opted for a retention period of 26 months
any data beyond this period is deleted from Google servers.
Do not track option
Do Not Track is a technology that enables visitors to opt out from being tracked by websites for whatever purpose, including the use of analytics services, advertising networks and social platforms
You can enable the 'Do not track' option directly in your web browser
Google Analytics will not track users who have enabled this option in their web browsers.
