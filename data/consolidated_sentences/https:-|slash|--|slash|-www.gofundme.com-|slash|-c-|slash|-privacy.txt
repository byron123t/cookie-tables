When you create a fundraiser on the Platform, we collect the information you choose to provide us in relation to your fundraiser and we display it through our Platform
For example, you can provide a fundraiser title, choose a fundraiser category, upload images and describe your fundraiser goal(s).

By providing information in a fundraiser, you consent to our collection, storage and use of your data

We reserve the right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in any messages that are sent to them.
Our payment processors also collect and maintain information related to your withdrawal of funds from any fundraiser.

VI
Communications to GoFundMe:
You may contact us via a contact form, email, by chat services or by other means (for example, with questions about our Services, for customer support, or to let us know your ideas for new products or modifications to existing products)
You may also choose to respond to surveys that we send out, or queries about your fundraisers
When you do so, we collect the information you choose to provide us, such as your contact details, any images you choose to upload and the contents and nature of your message.

VII
Information relating to third parties:
You can choose to provide us with information relating to third parties
For example, if you choose to share your fundraiser with family and friends through our Platform’s texting services
If you decide to do that, we give you the option to either add information to our Platform or to provide us access to information stored in your email and mobile device’s address books, such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers of your contacts (collectively, “Third-Party Data”).
If you use any feature of the Services that allows you to communicate with third parties (such as to refer a third party to the Services or to communicate with them regarding a fundraiser or a donation), either by submitting Third-Party Data to the Services or otherwise permitting the Services to automatically access Third-Party Data in your possession, you acknowledge, represent, and agree (a) that you have the authority of the relevant third party for us to access and use the relevant Third-Party Data, and (b) that you have notified these third parties and informed them how their information is collected and used by GoFundMe to provide the Services.
We reserve the right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in any messages that are sent to them
We use Third-Party Data to (1) contact such third party using the Third-Party Data provided, and/or (2) provide you with an editable template message designed to facilitate communication between you and such third party through the Services
In addition to sending the foregoing communications, we may also send reminders or related messages to you and to third parties on your behalf from time to time where permitted by applicable law
In each case, any such communications sent to third parties using Third-Party Data will provide a means to “opt out” of receiving further communication of the same nature.

GoFundMe may use any information which has manifestly been made public to make inferences about you, including processing information about you that reveals sensitive information.
When you provide such information to us, directly or indirectly, you consent to the processing of this data by GoFundMe and/or its service providers
We collect the information listed in this section for the purposes described below in the sections “Our Use of Information Collected” and “Our Disclosure of Information Collected Through the Services.

These biometric information services provide us with a confirmation as to whether your identity has been validated or not

OUR DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE SERVICES
There are certain circumstances in which we share information collected through the Services with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below.
A
Business Transfers:
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets
In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, similar event, or steps taken in anticipation of such events (e.g., due diligence in a transaction), user information may be part of the transferred assets.
B
Affiliates and Subsidiaries:
We share your personal information among the GoFundMe entities, including our affiliates and subsidiaries, in order to provide our Services including: hosting, marketing and publicizing fundraisers
providing you with customer support

authenticating donors
sending you communications
and conducting the other activities described in this Notice.
C
Agents, Consultants, Vendors and Related Third Parties:
GoFundMe contracts with other companies to perform certain business-related functions on GoFundMe’s behalf, and we provide access to or share your information with these companies so they can perform services for us
Examples of such functions include marketing, mailing information, data storage, security, identity verification, fraud prevention, payment processing, legal services, and maintaining databases
For example, if you are a donor in Australia, GoFundMe’s Australian entity, GoFundMe Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 627 702 630) contracts with Adyen Australia for payment processing
Adyen Australia, therefore, will collect, process and store your information on behalf of GoFundMe
We limit the personal information provided to these service providers and entities to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
D
Third Parties that Partner With Us or our Affiliate or Offer Services You Choose to Link:
GoFundMe shares personal information with third parties that partner with us on various initiatives and/or that offer services you choose to link to your GoFundMe fundraiser or that are linked to a GoFundMe fundraiser to which you may donate
Examples of this are Social Networking Services and their integrated social media tools or “plug-ins,” or other groups such as Caring Bridge or The Knot
When GoFundMe shares personal information with third parties, we require those third parties to handle the information in accordance with relevant laws
When you link to or interact directly with third-party companies (or you donate to GoFundMe fundraisers that are linked), their use of your personal information and your use of their features are governed by the privacy notices of those companies
We encourage you to carefully read their privacy notices.
E
Legal Requirements:
GoFundMe can access, disclose, transfer and preserve your information when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to: (i) comply with the law including with subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, and other legal process
and respond to inquiries or requests from government, regulatory, law enforcement, public authorities, or content protection organizations
(ii) protect and defend the legal rights, privacy, safety or property of GoFundMe, its affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, agents, contractors, or its users

For example, if an individual starts a fundraiser for a Charity and you donate to that fundraiser, then if the information is requested, (i) the Charity can receive information about both the organizer, if not the same, and donors, and (ii) organizer can receive donor information
In the same scenario, the beneficiary may communicate with you about your donation and/or may rely on your information in order to comply with its legal and auditing requirements.
