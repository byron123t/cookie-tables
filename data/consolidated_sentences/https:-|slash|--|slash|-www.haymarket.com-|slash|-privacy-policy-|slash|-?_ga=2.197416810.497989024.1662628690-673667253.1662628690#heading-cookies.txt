Under the GDPR there are six lawful bases under which organisations can collect, use and store personal data
We have identified four which we rely upon for our business activities: Consent, Contractual, Legitimate Interests and Legal Obligation.
Contractual – in many circumstances we rely on the lawful basis of “performance of a contract”, this enables us to respond to you when you express an interest in our products and services and to fulfil any requests
To learn more please see How we use your personal data.
Consent – in some circumstances we rely on your specific consent, whereby you actively agree and “opt-in”
We will always make it clear how you can withdraw you consent at any time
To learn more please see How to stop marketing communications.
Legal Obligation – there will be circumstances under which we are legally obliged to hold your personal data or required to disclose it to a third party by law.
Legitimate Interests – for some of our activities we rely on our legitimate business interests to collect and use your personal data
In such cases, we have balanced our interests with yours and do not believe these activities will have a negative impact on your privacy rights and freedoms
We specifically rely on Legitimate Interests to:
manage specific aspects of our events

How we use your personal data
Magazine subscriptions
If you subscribe to receive one of our magazines, we will use the details you provide us to send you the magazine, to process your payment details, to provide you access to any digital content that’s part of your subscription, to respond to any queries you may have and to contact you with information relating to your subscription (e.g
to confirm your subscription has started, to confirm if your subscription is due to expire, to send you password reminder emails, or to notify you of any changes to the service).
Online accounts
Creating an online account with one of our websites gives you access to further functionality, features and content
You can create an online account directly when you register or subscribe
The personal details we collect when you  create an online account will include your name, email address, username and password
We also collect the IP address you are using to access our website to enable us to provide IP-based subscriptions and to detect and prevent any account misuse.
Corporate subscriptions operate by providing access to our website based on the domain name of the email address given when creating a user account, or based on detecting the IP address used to access our website
This information would have been shared with us by the organisation who requested the corporate subscription.
During the registration process, you may provide us with further details about yourself, such as your job title and the industry sector you work in
We use these details, combined with other information you have shared with us, to help tailor the content and advertising you see to be more relevant  to you, to personalise the marketing messages we send to you and to provide context to our research and analysis of how our websites are used.
To learn more, please read the sections on Research, Personalise marketing and website content and Client advertising on other websites.
Car buying enquiries
The What Car? purpose-built e-commerce platform has been specifically designed to connect potential customers who intend to buy new cars with dealers across the UK
We require some basic contact details to create an online account giving you access to car offers from dealers in your local area (based on your postcode)
In order to provide a tailored quote for personal finance or a part exchange valuation we also ask for your annual mileage, payment terms, deposit amount and your current vehicle’s registration number.
With your consent, we will share your details with the dealer whose car offer you are interested in
Dealers will respond to your enquiry either through our platform, by email or telephone
The dealer will only use your details to get in touch about your enquiry
We always provide a link to the dealer’s own privacy notice so you can learn more about how they will use your personal data
We will notify you via email about your enquiry as part of this service.
During the registration process, we sometimes ask if you would like to hear directly from the car manufacturer’s own local dealer about information on cars, test drives and brochure requests
You will have a clear choice and if you agree, we will share the details you provided us during your registration with the car manufacturer
This will include your name, email address and phone number
We will provide you with a link to their own privacy notice so you can learn more about how they will process your personal data.
When you request a car valuation we require some basic contact details, information on the car you’re valuing, why you’re using this service and what the make and model of your next car is likely to be
We use this information to send you an email with your car valuation and to help tailor what services we offer you
For example, if you tell us you’re buying a car that’s made by a particular manufacturer, we’ll ask if you also want to hear from them directly
If you agree, we’ll share the details you provided (when you requested a car valuation) with the car manufacturer
This will include your name, postcode, email address and telephone number.
To help our automotive clients measure the effectiveness of the car enquiries they receive from our customers, they provide us with a list of postcodes and associated sales data
We use this to match against the records we hold to produce an anonymous report
We share this report with our clients to indicate the volume of sales that can be attributed to our services
No personal data is shared with our automotive clients for this purpose.
Events
Some of our brands will organise events to provide the latest information, insight and opinions from a wide range of industry sectors
These events can be delivered face-to-face at a physical venue or virtually through an online platform either in real time or on demand.
We will use the personal details you provide us when you register to attend an event so we know who’s attending and to allow access
When attending a virtual event, the name you provided during the registration process may be displayed to all other attendees
If you are making a group booking or booking on someone’s behalf, please ensure you have their permission to share their name and contact details with us.With your permission, we may share some of your contact details with our event sponsors, speakers or exhibitors to be used for their direct marketing activities

Photographs and video footage may be taken at our events and used in post-event publicity or future promotional material
If you don’t want to be captured in any photos or video footage, please let the photographer know on the day of the event
You can also email us if you believe you have been included in a photograph or video footage and object to it being used for post-event publicity or future promotional material.
For some of our events, you may be asked for your badge to be scanned by our seminar hosts, sponsors and exhibitors
This allows us to confirm who attended a seminar and provides a way for our sponsors and exhibitors to send you further information about the event, using the details you provided us when you registered
Privacy notices will be displayed on the day of the event to inform you of this activity
If you do not wish for your details to be shared in this way, then please feel free to object to your badge from being scanned.
We will sometimes provide a formal meal with a set menu and table service at some of our events
You are given the opportunity to inform us of any dietary requirements during the registration process
We only use this information for the purpose of your attendance at the event
To ensure we’re able to meet these requirements, we have to share this information with venues so you receive your dietary choice.
For some of our events, the content is spread out over a few days and some delegates are provided with accommodation at venues hosting the event
To ensure a seamless professional service, we share personal details with venues to ensure rooms are booked under their name, and to enable easy check-in.
You may voluntarily inform us of specific accessibility requirements that help us ensure the service we provide you is specific to your needs

provided your consent (e.g

where we believe we can demonstrate a legitimate business interest and have balanced this with your interests and privacy.
It is always your choice and you can stop receiving direct marketing communications from us at any time

Personalised marketing & website content
We want to ensure our marketing communications are of interest to you
We therefore use the information you have given us to tailor our messages to be more relevant
We will use details such as your job title, industry sector, geographical location, previous transactional history, website usage and your interactions with our marketing content to try and do this
You have the right to object, but this will mean we are unable to send you marketing communications in the future, as we do not wish to send irrelevant messages to you.
To learn more, please read our section on How to stop marketing communications.
We provide tailored content recommendations to users of our Business Brands websites as we believe that customers find website content more interesting and significant when it is more relevant to them
Our recommendations are based on analysing the content viewed by users and displaying other related content, popular content or personalised content based on their subscription type
To help us to tailor our recommendations, we use tracking technologies to identify which pages of our website you have visited combined with some of your subscription and account details (e.g
your user ID and subscription type).
If you don’t want to receive personalised content recommendations, then you can opt out by disabling functional cookies on the specific website you are visiting
You can do this by clicking on the “Cookie Settings” link located on every page.
Research & analytics
When you use our website, you may be asked for your feedback and opinions
Your answers will help us improve our products and services, develop new ones, and provide information for our editorial articles
If you’re a subscriber then we may use some of the information you have provided before to help summarise the answers and give our analysis further context
For example, a question that simply asks if you listen to industry podcasts, can be combined with the job title you previously provided us to report that 80% of Marketing Managers listen to industry podcasts.
We use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers interact across our websites so that we can deliver better experiences and learn what works and what doesn’t
We also use Google Analytics Advertising features on some of our websites to create audience segments based on specific actions performed so we can retarget customers with advertising
No information will be passed to Google that could be recognised as personally identifiable information (e.g
your name or email address)
The types of personal data being processed when using Google Analytics include online identifiers, cookie identifiers and IP addresses.
When you visit our websites, we will tell you that we use cookies and other tracking technologies
You can give your permission and can change your preferences at any time
You can do this by clicking on the “Cookie Settings” link located on every page.
For full details on how Google processes your data please visit: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Website notifications
A notification about the latest content from our websites can be sent to visitors using their browser or internet device
The notification can be displayed in different ways depending on the browser and operating system that’s being used
A notification is only sent to visitors that have opted in to receive them
Information is collected about the visitor’s browser or internet device, the date and time of their first and last visit, and the number of times visited
This information is linked to a cookie identifier
For more information about cookies, please visit our Cookie Notice
If a visitor wishes to unsubscribe from receiving notifications they should follow these instructions.
Prize draws and prize competitions
We will use the personal details you provide us to administer any prize draw or prize competition you decide to enter
The personal details we collect may include your name, email address, phone number, and postal address
These details will be used to notify you if you’ve been shortlisted or if you’re the winner
We will only share the details you provide us with a third party if they need this information to deliver or to fulfil the prize.
If you’re the winner of a prize draw or prize competition, your details may be used for publicity or promotional purposes
If you don’t want your details used in this way, please notify us when we inform you that you’ve won
For more information, please visit our competition terms and conditions.
Online advertising
We show adverts on many of our websites and this is crucial for our business as it helps us to fund the content and services we offer
We display adverts for our own products and services and also adverts from other companies we think you’ll be interested in
To give you more detail there are two different types of online advertising:
contextual advertising
online behavioural advertising
What is contextual advertising?
This is when adverts are shown to you based on the content of the specific page you are visiting
For example, if you visit a page with a car review on our whatcar.com website, the adverts you’ll see may relate to the manufacturer of the car you are reading about.
What is online behavioural advertising?
Online behavioural advertising is based on the activities you perform (i.e
the pages you view, links you click on, time spent on a page, adverts viewed, etc.) on our websites, rather than just the specific page you are visiting.
From these visits we can learn what you are interested in to build a profile and then personalise the adverts you see
For example, if you visit our compaignlive.co.uk website and read articles about how to produce creative content, you may start to see adverts from creative agencies, regardless of what page you are currently on.
We may also show you personalised adverts on our website based on the activities you perform on other websites
Advertising technology companies help perform this operation by creating and sharing user IDs and matching them with one another to identify the same visitor across multiple websites.
Client advertising on other websites
Online behavioural advertising can also be used to display relevant advertising to you when you visit other websites, based on the different pieces of content and advertising you viewed on our websites.
This is currently achieved in two separate ways
The first method involves us creating audience segments based on specific actions performed on our websites
Cookie IDs are synced across the different advertising technology partners, allowing advertising clients to target the same segment with their advertising on different websites
The second method involves us permitting advertising technology partners to collect technical information directly from your browser for them to provide advertising opportunities to their clients based on you visiting our websites.
This activity is only performed with your consent, which is collected when you first visit one of our websites via our consent management popup
You can change your mind at any time by clicking on the “Cookie Settings” link located on every page.
If you’re a website subscriber to one of our Business Brands, then we may also associate some of the further details you provided, such as your job title and the industry sector you work in, with a user ID stored on your browser and share this with advertising technology partners.
For a list of the advertising technology partners we work with, please read our section on Advertising technology partners.
What information do we collect?
The information we collect doesn’t include personal details like your name or email address, instead it’s information about the pages you’ve visited, how many times you’ve visited and what content or advertising you’ve clicked on
This information is linked to a unique identifier stored on your browser or internet device
We create groups of visitors that have performed specific actions, and work with our advertising clients and advertising agencies, so we can show relevant adverts to the group when they next visit our website
For example we might have a group ‘interested in creative content’ who might see adverts from a creative agency.
What is Real Time Bidding?
On some of our websites we sometimes allow multiple advertisers to compete against each other to display their advertising to you
We use a number of different advertising partners who have their own relationships with advertising clients
They help us with the sale of our advertising space by hosting auctions to achieve the highest revenue possible
The advertising client with the winning bid can then display their advertising to you
Our advertising partners will collect information from your browser to be used in the auction
This will not include personal details like your name or email address
Instead, it will include information about the type of browser you use, any cookie or device identifiers, IP addresses and associated geo-location data, the web pages you visited, including dates and times, your internet service provider, and information about the types of advertising that’s been displayed to you and whether you clicked on it
Our advertising partners may have collected some of this information from other websites you have visited
Learn more about our Advertising technology partners.
Measurement and reporting
To make sure our advertising is relevant and effective, both us and our advertising partners check if particular adverts have been seen and whether they were clicked on
This also helps to limit the number of times an ad is shown to you.
Haymarket works with Google to deliver advertising on our websites which can be measured using conversion tracking functionality
A conversion takes place when a customer sees or clicks on an advert displayed on a Haymarket website, then performs a subsequent action, such as visiting an advertiser web page
This subsequent action is tracked with an activity tag that Haymarket generates using Google’s advertising services
We send this activity tag to our advertisers to implement on their websites or mobile apps
Whenever a customer visits the advertiser’s web page which has the activity tag, Google checks to see whether this customer had previously seen or clicked on an advert displayed on a Haymarket website within the last 30 days
For more information about conversion tracking, please see Google’s help guide
The personal data being processed as part of this functionality is limited to a unique identifier within a Google cookie called “__glc”, which collects related information confirming the customer’s visit to a specific advertiser’s web page.
Cookies
Many of the activities described above rely on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies set on our sites by us and our advertising partners
The profiles created use cookies that uniquely identify your browser or internet device and link all the information collected together
We don’t collect or use personal details like your name or email address
When you visit our websites, we tell you that we use cookies and other tracking technologies
You can give your permission and can change your preferences at any time
To learn more please visit our cookie notice.
How to stop receiving marketing communications
We don’t want to send you marketing communications if you do not want to receive them
You can stop receiving these messages from us at anytime.
We have a diverse range of brands in our Haymarket Automotive, and Haymarket Business Media divisions, which you may not realise are all published by Haymarket Media Group
You may therefore wish to be selective and just stop receiving marketing communications from one brand rather than from them all.
Emails: There will always be an unsubscribe link on any marketing email you receive from us

When you provide us with your vehicle registration when requesting a car valuation on our whatcar.com website, we will share this with CAP HPI to help us determine the value of your car
We do not share any other personal data with CAP HPI
Please visit the CAP HPI privacy notice to learn more about how they process your personal data.
Legal disclosure
We may need to disclose your personal data to comply with any legal obligation
These requests will be verified before we consider to share your details.
Changes to our company
In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal data may be among the assets transferred.
Social Media
Using social media sign-in
On some of our websites we enable you to sign in using your social media account like Google, Twitter or Facebook
We will inform you if we wish to access more than just basic account information during this process, so you can let us know you are happy to share these details with us
We recommend you also check what permissions you enable in your social media profiles.
Social media share widgets
We use social media widgets allowing you, for example, to ‘Like’ or ‘Tweet’ a particular piece of content on our websites
We use different social media platforms to help us do this, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter
When social media share widgets are used on our websites, limited technical information is shared with the social media platform
This will include any cookie or device identifiers, IP addresses, the type of device, the browser and operating system
For more information please read the ‘Information From Partners’ section on Facebook’s privacy notice, the ‘Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages’ section on LinkedIn’s privacy notice and the ‘Information we receive from third parties’ section on Twitter’s privacy notice.
Social media marketing
We use social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google and Twitter to display online advertising in order to provide information about the products and services from our different brands
To help us ensure the advertising that is displayed remains relevant, we sometimes use the audience features provided by the social media platforms to identify specific groups of our customers, or other groups that share similar characteristics as our customers
This will involve using a website pixel or an email address you have previously shared with us.
When email addresses are used to create an audience on Facebook, they are scrambled before sharing using a SHA-256 hashing algorithm, transforming them to randomised code (hash) that cannot be reversed
The hash will always be the same for the same email address
This means Facebook can use the hash (rather than your email address) and find any identical hashed versions of email addresses that exist in their systems
All hashes are subsequently deleted including any unmatched records ensuring no additional personal data is shared.
We will only use your email address, where we have previously received your permission, to send you direct marketing messages
If you would like to object to your email address being used for social media marketing, please use our contact details to do this.
We use website pixels from social media platforms to identify customers who have visited or have performed a specific action on our websites
The pixels are used to build customer segments and display relevant advertising to customers within the social media platform using the audience features provided
We also allow third party advertising clients to display their own advertising to the same customer segments
We will only do this when you have given us permission for the social media website pixel to be used on our websites.
When you visit our websites, we tell you that we use cookies and other tracking technologies
You can give your permission and can change your preferences at any time
You can do this by clicking on the “Cookie Settings” link located on every page
To learn more, please visit our Cookie Notice.
Using message boards and chat
Any information which you choose to voluntarily post to message boards, chat rooms and other interactive forums, is by its very nature being made publicly available to other users who have access to that portion of a website or service
We would encourage you not to share your personal data and we are not responsible for any information you choose to provide or communicate in such forums
Any disclosures you make are at your own risk.
If you are having difficulty deleting or editing a post, please email: data.protection@haymarket.com
Protecting children
All of our brands are aimed at adults and are not designed for use by children
However, we accept that on occasion children may visit our websites
Where we believe any of our brands may attract children under the age of 16, we will clearly provide information notices to try and deter children from providing their personal data.
We clearly stipulate that entry into any of our competitions is only available to over 18s
In exceptional circumstances we may lower this, but never lower than 16 and this will always be clearly stipulated in the terms and conditions for the specific competition.
We do not knowingly intend to send marketing communications to children.
We actively encourage all our staff, whenever they are implementing new promotions, offers or events to assess whether these might be attractive to children and if so, will ensure clear information is provided to try and deter children from providing their personal data.
If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned that we may be processing personal data related to your child, please use Our contact details.

Where we employ service providers, we have appropriate agreements in place to ensure your personal data is protected.

How long do we keep your personal data
We hold personal data for a variety of different purposes and the length of time we keep your information for will vary depending on the products and services we are providing to you
We will only keep your personal data for a reasonable period of time and we base this on the purpose for which we are using it.
There will be circumstances in which we keep a strictly minimal amount of information about you, for example to ensure we can honour an objection to receiving direct marketing
We will also, in specific circumstances, be required to retain personal data for a longer period of time for contractual or legal reasons.
We have a detailed internal schedule for ensuring we do not hold your personal data for longer than we justifiably need it
To learn more please use Our contact details.
Reporting security vulnerabilities
We are committed to the privacy, safety and security of our customers
If you discover a potential security vulnerability, we would ask you to please report it just to us in a responsible manner
Please email us at data.protection@haymarket.com and we will respond to you as soon as possible
This provides us with an opportunity to work with you and quickly address and resolve any issue
Publicly disclosing a potential vulnerability could put the wider community at risk, and therefore we encourage you to come to us first
We’ll keep you informed as we move forward with our investigations.

The aim of our Cookie Notice is to provide you with a summary of the tracking technologies we use and how you can control what is set and when

Cookies and tracking technologies we use
Where Haymarket Media Group Ltd or its group companies talk about cookies and tracking technology on our websites (please see Our brands) we refer to the following:

Web Beacons
To help us better manage content we employ web beacons in emails that we send to our customers
Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier and are used to track the online movements of internet users
Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites
We use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients enabling us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Pixels
A pixel refers to the code that is placed on your computer in order to trigger a cookie
We sometimes use this methodology to allow us to deliver more relevant messages to you e.g
to understand how you interact with our email marketing.
Log Files
We use log files to record events that occur on our websites
This may include, though not exclusively, the type, content or time of transaction made via your device
These audit trails allow us to analyse activities on our websites.
