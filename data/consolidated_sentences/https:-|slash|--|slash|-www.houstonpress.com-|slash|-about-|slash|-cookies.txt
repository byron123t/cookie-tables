Last Updated: August 27, 2018
Voice Media Group ("us", "we", or "our") uses cookies on the http://www.houstonpress.com website (the "Service")
By using the Service, you consent to the use of cookies
Our Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use cookies, how third-parties we partner with use cookies on the Service, your choices regarding cookies and further information about cookies.
What are cookies
Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your web browser by a website you visit
A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Service or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Service more useful to you.
The period during which a cookie is stored on the device you are browsing with depends on whether it is a "persistent" or a "session" cookie
Session cookies are only stored on a device until the web browser is closed
Permanent cookies remain on the device after you have finished browsing until they expire or are deleted.
How Voice Media Group uses cookies
When you use and access the Service, we place a number of cookies files in your web browser.
We use cookies for the following purposes:
To enable certain functions of the Service;
To provide data analytics on your use of the Service;
To store your preferences;
To enable advertisements delivery, including behavioral advertising.
We use both session and persistent cookies on the Service and we use different types of cookies to run the Service:
Essential cookies
These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Services
They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Service.
Functionality cookies
We use these cookies to recognise you when you return to our Service
This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
Analytics cookies
We use analytics cookies to track information about how the Service is used so that we can make improvements (for example, to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it)
We also use analytics cookies to test new advertisements, pages, features or new functionality on the Service to see how our users react to them.
Advertising cookies
We use these cookies to offer you personalized and more relevant advertisements, to determine how many times a certain advertisement has already been shown, to calculate the effectiveness of a certain advertising campaign, to keep track of data from a previous visit and to share the data collected with the third parties involved, such as the advertisers.
Third-party cookies
In addition to the cookies we deliver to your device through the Service, certain third parties may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons.
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Website
To learn more about Google Analytics, click here
We also use Google’s AdSense and DoubleClick services
You can use Google’s Ads Settings to manage the Google ads you see and opt out of Ads Personalization
If you do not want information about your visit to the Service sent to Google Analytics, you may download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here
Please note that the Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to Voice Media Group.
Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors across non-affiliated websites and delivering targeted advertisements either on the Service or on other websites
As explained in our Privacy Policy, in addition to the various Google services listed above, we use the behavioral remarketing services below, which deliver cookies to your device when you use the Service:

You will be directed to industry-developed websites that allow you to choose whether each listed entity may collect and use data for interest-based advertising purposes
It may be that some of the third parties that collect interest-based information through the Service do not participate in the Website Opt Out or Your Online Choices, in which case the best way to avoid third party tracking of your online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies.
The Website Opt Out described above works only on websites

As with the Website Opt Out, the “Mobile App Opt Out” prevents tracking only by participating entities.
