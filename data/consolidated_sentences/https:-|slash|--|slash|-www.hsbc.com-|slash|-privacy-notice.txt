Privacy notice
Hello
Nice to see you here.
When you browse the web, you leave a digital footprint
It’s information about your device and the way you use it online.
We just want to let you know that we’ll collect this information about you
Most websites do this.
We use this information to deliver the website to you
We also use it for other things, which we think help you and us.
We’ve put this notice together to explain this
Don’t worry
It takes a little over 7 minutes to read.
By the way, when we say “we” this means the HSBC group of companies and our trusted partners who provide services to us.
These include our:
Technology providers
Cybersecurity companies
Social media partners
Advertising partners
The data controller for this website and for the processing activities carried out on this website is HSBC Holdings plc
We’ve set out contact details at the end of this notice if you need to reach us.
Our privacy notices
This is our website notice.
We have other notices
Some of these may apply to you as well
It depends on how you choose to interact with us.
Public website notice (you are here): this notice covers parts of this website where you don’t need a password (like this page)
Full privacy notice: our full privacy notices contain more information to read alongside this notice
These notices are country/territory-specific and will tell you more details, such as the full company names of HSBC’s data controllers in those countries and territories, and the products and services they cover
They also tell you how HSBC uses your personal information in general for those products and services and in those countries and territories
You can read them by visiting the website for the relevant product or service, or you can contact your customer services team for a copy
A list of these websites can be found on our Contact us page
Cookie notice: this notice covers how we collect information from your web browser or mobile device
Other notices: some of our apps or parts of our websites have their own privacy notices
For example, our mobile apps have privacy notices
So does our careers section of our website at hsbc.com/careers
You can usually find our notices in the footer of the webpage
If you’re using an app, it will usually be in the menu
Our full privacy notice is our main one and can be found by visiting the website for the product or services we provide you
A list of these websites can be found on our Contact us page

We also do this when you visit one of our social media sites.

Your device and internet connection details such as: type of device you’re using, IP address and details about your internet connection, technical details such as your screen size and the software you’re using, such as your web browser
Your country or region (not exactly where you are unless we ask permission)
Your unique advertising or other identification numbers allocated to your browser or device

Some of this data is collected by:
Our partners: these may be website hosts or social media sites
Cyber-security filtering technology: this keeps our website safe from fraud and crime
Cookies and similar technology: these are set on your device by us and our trusted partners
We don’t often know exactly who you are from this data
But sometimes we may connect this data with other information we hold about you.
For example:
If you browse our website and then access online banking, we may connect this data to you
The next time you visit, we may still link that data to you
If you browse our website while logged into social media accounts, then our partners may be able to connect this data to those accounts
It might be possible to connect your browsing data to personal data held by third parties.
We use your data when it is in our legitimate interests.
This means we need to have a valid and lawful reason to use your data and balance this with your interests.
How we use this personal information

Most websites do this.
To provide you with information
Respond to your questions
Provide you with information, products or services you have requested or which we feel may interest you
Provide you with alerts or updates if you sign up for them
We may need to share your information with other companies within the HSBC Group to provide you with information you have requested (for example, if you have raised a question regarding your products and services)
If we do this, the relevant full privacy notice will also apply to how we use your information.

What you say: like comments or reactions
Your actions: like sharing or recommending

This is not your precise location unless you have provided this in your user profile and you are logged-in
Your device and internet connection
Your Facebook profile details and user ID
HSBC has access to this information to use for reporting, insights and marketing purposes and so does Facebook.
This helps HSBC improve our offering on Facebook and create better marketing
HSBC may also see this information if HSBC has communicated with you on Facebook
HSBC does this because it helps us know who we’re speaking to.
If you’ve allowed us to use cookies that support our marketing, HSBC and Facebook can collect this information when you use HSBC’s site too
To learn more, or to switch this off, please visit our Cookie notice at https://www.hsbc.com/cookie-notice
You can control which cookies you allow by selecting “Manage Cookies”.
Within the European Union, Facebook Ireland is a ‘joint controller’ with us in law for processing where we collect information about you:
From your actions on our Facebook page
Through the Facebook pixel on our website
We and Facebook have agreed to share some responsibilities to protect your personal data, by:
Making sure we each have a legal basis for joint processing
Honouring your legal rights in respect of your data
Ensuring security of joint processing
You can contact HSBC about how we do this
You can also contact Facebook about what they do
This includes exercising your legal rights in respect of the data Facebook collects and retains itself.
Further details of how Facebook processes your personal information, the legal basis it relies on, your rights and Facebook’s contact details can be found at:
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy
Your rights
We think carefully about how we use your information
We always aim to use it in a way that’s fair to you
You might prefer us not to use it for some purposes.
You have a legal right to:
Ask us to provide you with copies of your personal information, make corrections or sometimes ask us to delete it
Object to our processing of your information in some circumstances
For example, to ask us not to share your personal information for online advertising
Complain to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office by visiting ico.org.uk  or to the data protection regulator in the country where you are
We may not always be able to stop processing your information, such as if we’re using it to help protect you or others
Other important information
We have a couple more things to tell you.
Transfers: we may transfer your information outside of the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area
If this happens your information may not have the same level of protection
Security: we’ll use a range of measures to keep your information safe and secure, such as encryption
Storage: we keep your information in line with our data retention policy
We do this to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and for our legitimate purposes
