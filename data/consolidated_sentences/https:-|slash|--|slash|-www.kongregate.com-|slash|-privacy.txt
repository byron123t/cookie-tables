WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA.
Service Providers
We may use third party service providers to perform services for us such as to provide the
infrastructure and IT services (including but not limited to data storage), process credit and debit card transactions,
to provide customer services, collecting debt analysis and improve data and process customer inquiries and perform other
statistical analyzes
In the performance of these services, the third party vendors may have access to your personal
data but are only authorized to process it strictly on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.
Third Party Advertising and User Acquisition Partners
We have advertising on our Services so we can offer continue to offer many of our Services for
free
Subject to your settings, we provide certain information to advertisers who will use them to serve you with ads in our Platform, and we measure who sees and clicks on their ads
We may also use
aggregate information to monitor usage of our Services in order to help us improve and develop our Services, and we may provide such aggregate information to third parties, e.g., content partners or advertisers
This aggregate information does not include personal data and cannot be linked to you
When advertisers, ad networks or user acquisition partners place ads in our Services, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our Services:
performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);
aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to
specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 21 and 25 who live San Francisco);
certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as IDFAs, and
de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID);
your social network ID;
and other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level and session length).
The information collected may be used to:
measure how effective ads are, to offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you
advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as behavioral
advertising), and/or
undertake web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics which is used to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve
your experience).
Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons
After clicking on a third party advertisement, you may no longer be on our Platform
The third party
sites are operated by companies that are outside of our control, and your activities at those sites will be governed by
the policies and practices of those third parties
We encourage you to review the list of third party advertising and user acquisition partners and their privacy policies before disclosing any personally identifiable information, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices
of those sites.
Offer Walls
Our Services may display an “offer wall” that is hosted by an offer wall provider
The offer wall allows third-party
advertisers to provide virtual currency to players in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a
marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers
After clicking on one of these
offers, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Kongregate or the social network through which you are playing
Kongregate games
To properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your
Kongregate user name/ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider.
3rd Party Developers
Most of the games on our Platforms are created by 3rd party developers
These 3rd party developers
may request, by using Kongregate’s SDK and APIs, certain publicly visible information about users that play their games, e.g., your username, your user_id (a numeric ID associated with your
account that persists even if a username is changed) In order to fix bugs
The legal basis of this processing is Article
6(1)(b) of GDPR.
Third Parties for Security or Other Legitimate Reasons

reasonably believe that disclosure of such personal data is necessary:
to comply with valid legal obligations including subpoenas, court orders, governmental requests or search warrants, and
as otherwise authorized by law
The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(c) of GDPR.
to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our customers, employees or the general public.
The legal basis of
this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR.
to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of our Services and to protect our
network, services, devices and users from such use
The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR
We
have an interest to provide our Services without fraud
This interest outweighs the user’s interest in not having
personal data processed.
to advance or defend against complaints or legal claims
The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR.
We have an interest to defend against complaints or legal claims
This interest outweighs the user’s interest in not
having personal data processed.
to determine credit risk
The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR

credit risks in order to protect our economic interest
This interest outweighs the user’s interest in not having
personal data processed.
or to obtain payment for our Services
The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR.
to outside auditors and regulators in case of legal obligations
The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(c)
of GDPR.
Intra-Group Transfers
We may disclose your personal data to other companies within our parent company if it is
necessary for the provision of our Services to you (the legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR)
If
you have agreed thereto, we may also disclose your personal data to affiliate companies owned or operated by our parent
company for marketing purposes (the legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(a) of GDPR)
The affiliate companies
who may have access to your personal data follow practices consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Corporate Transaction, Reorganization or Bankruptcy
In the event of a change of control, sale of some or all of our
business or assets, corporate reorganization or bankruptcy, we would share the pertinent customer information (which may
include your personal information) with the other business entity (or entities) involved in the transaction
In such an
event, we would notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Platform of any change in ownership or uses of
your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information
The legal basis of
this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR.
Legal Compliance
We may disclose information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required
by law to do so
The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(c) of GDPR.
Disclosure under California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”)
We do not rent or sell personal information collected
by or from any Service or portion of a Service that is directed to Children or where we know that the user is a Child.
For the portions of our Services that are directed to audiences who are not Children, we do not sell identifying information such as name, email address, phone number, or postal
address, but we may share identifiers such as cookies and the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device
with our advertising partners, and those partners may use and share those identifiers to show ads that are targeted to
your interests
If this takes place, these disclosures may constitute a “sale” under California law.
In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold any personal information, but we have disclosed the following
categories of personal information for a business purpose:
Category A: Identifiers.
Category B: California Customer Records personal information categories.
Category D: Commercial Information.
Category F: Internet or other similar network activity.
Category G: Geolocation data.

HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide our Services to you and fulfill the purposes
described in this Privacy Policy
We do periodic status checks to review when personal data needs to be deleted.
However, as we process your personal data for various purposes, the actual period for which the personal data will be
stored will depend on the circumstances.
PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT LOGGED-IN OR USED OUR SERVICES FOR A CONSECUTIVE
PERIOD OF AT LEAST THREE (3) OR FOUR (4) YEARS, AS APPLICABLE, YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE
DELETED AUTOMATICALLY AND WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY
POLICY
Starting on or around July 1, 2022, we will automatically delete any user data and close the

(3) consecutive years IF such user (A) has not spent any money on our Services, AND (B) has not
accumulated any achievements, badges, Kongpanions etc
We will automatically delete user data and
close the Accounts of all other users who do not meet the criteria specified in (A) and (B) above when such
users have been inactive and have not logged in on any of our Platforms for at least four (4) consecutive
years.
When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal
or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we cannot identify you
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may retain certain financial-related information, esp
if you have made purchases within the Services, for up to seven (7) years after such purchase in compliance with U.S
law and certain contractual legal data for up to ten (10) years after the termination or expiration of the obligations or even after you have closed your account with us if this is necessary to comply with legal requirements or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.
While we endeavor to honor your requests related to your personal data, we may not be fully able to honor the request
until a later time or we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service
provider(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested,
take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise
perform our contract with you;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those
responsible for such activities;

HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We strive to maintain the security of your personal information through a variety of security measures
Safeguarding
your personal data is a priority for us
Personal data that you provide to us is stored on secure servers, and we use
rigorous procedures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your
personal data
Although we work hard to protect your personal data, please note that no system can be guaranteed to be
100% secure
Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to
its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or
disclose personal data, and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we
cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to any login or password information, and to your
computer or device
To minimize the risk of having your account being compromised, we recommend that you set up your
account password using unique numbers, letters and special characters
Do not disclose passwords to others
Please
notify us of any password compromises and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection
To learn more
about how to protect yourself online, we encourage you to visit the government’s website at www.onguardonline.gov.

OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN.
Our Services are Not Designed for Children
Our Services, Platform and 3rd Party Platform Games are generally designed
for and directed at people 18 years of age or older
No one under the age of 13 within the United States (or up to the
age of 16 for children located in certain European countries)(collectively, “Children”) may provide any personal
information to us, and we do not knowingly collect information from Children except in connection with the following
Apps which Kongregate has designated as directed to Children (collectively, our “Children-Appealing Games”).
For our limited collection of Children-Appealing Games, we recognize a special obligation to further protect personal
information collected from Children
We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names,
addresses or phone numbers without permission
Some of the features of our Children-Appealing Games are age-gated so
that they are not available for use by Children
When we intend to collect personal information from Children, we take
additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:
Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information

(IDFA)) or Google Advertiser ID (GAID), browser type, language settings, internet service provider, network status, time
zone, URL of the entry and exit pages, date of access and time spent, clickstream data, and other statistical
information about the use of our Services

Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising
and
Your Online Choices UK website for EU-based advertising.

your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device

can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s “settings” page, which will prevent
continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising Identifier.”
Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as
the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and
use of cross-app data for tailored advertising.

tailored to your interests, you may receive generic ads
