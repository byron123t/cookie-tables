Retention periods for records are determined based on the type of record and the nature of the activity
We normally keep customer account records for up to five years after your relationship with The Money and Pensions Service ends, whilst other records are retained for shorter periods, for example 90 days for CCTV records or 12 months for call recordings

What is Pension Wise?
Pension Wise is a free and impartial government service, from MoneyHelper, which helps you understand your defined contribution pension options.
The service is provided in partnership with Citizens Advice and Teleperformance.
10.4
How we use your information - booking a Pension Wise appointment
When you use our online booking system or call our booking phone line, you will be asked to provide your name, telephone number, email address, date of birth, and pension type which will be stored on our system and used for the purpose of checking eligibility and booking you an appointment slot at your desired time/location with one of our guidance specialists
We may use the telephone number you provide to send you a text to remind you that your appointment is coming up
We may also store data about any reasonable adjustments you may require to help you to access the appointment.
If you have no further contact with the Pension Wise service after booking an appointment (for example if you subsequently cancel the appointment and do not re-book), your personal data will be stored in our booking system for a maximum of 2 years from the date the booking was made and then deleted
Calls to our booking line are recorded and stored for 6 months.
For eligibility webchat with MoneyHelper, your transcript is stored for a period of 12 months before being deleted.
The lawful basis for MaPS processing personal data for this purpose is set out in Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulations.
10.5
How we use your information - guidance appointments
Face to face and telephone appointments are delivered through Citizens Advice, MoneyHelper and Teleperformance
During a Pension Wise guidance appointment questions will be asked about your personal and family affairs, financial arrangements and plans and general state of health to inform the discussion with the guidance specialist.
Details of these will be stored on our systems as part of the record of your appointment.
10.6
Legal basis for processing
The lawful basis for MaPS processing this data for the delivery of appointments in conjunction with our delivery partner (the Citizens Advice network) and storing your data securely for a maximum of 2 years, is set out in Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulations
“performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller” For telephone appointments with MoneyHelper and Citizens Advice, key details from your appointment are stored, and calls are recorded and stored, for two years before being deleted.
For appointments delivered by the Citizens Advice network, they will ask for your consent to store key details from your appointment for a period of six years, in line with their organisational retention policy
This is to respond to any comments/complaints that arise within the 6-year statute of the limitation period
The lawful basis for this is set out in Article 6(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulations
“the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes”.
For appointments delivered by Citizens Advice Scotland, key details from your appointment will be stored for 6 years, in line with their organisational retention policy
This is to respond to any comments/complaints that arise within the 6 year statute of limitation period
The lawful basis for this is set out in Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulations
“processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.”
Consent can be withdrawn at any time by contacting Citizens Advice directly, or by emailing contact.pensionwise@moneyhelper.org.uk.
10.7
Health data
For face to face appointments delivered by Citizens Advice England and Wales, any basic health data you provide when requesting an appointment online and during the appointment will be stored in general terms as part of the record of appointment, where it is relevant to your pension options (for example a health condition may entitle you to an enhanced annuity)
Where this occurs, processing and retention of this data for a maximum of 2 years is in accordance with Article 9(2)(g) of the General Data Protection Regulations, in reference to Schedule 1, Part 2(6)(1 and 2) of the Data Protection Act 2018
Citizens Advice will ask for your consent to store any basic health data discussed in your appointment for a period of six years, in line with their organisational retention policy
This consent process is in accordance with Article 9(2)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulations.
Citizens Advice Scotland does not keep a written record of health data relating to Pension Wise appointments
However, special category data that you disclose during a telephone appointment will be stored on an audio recording for 2 years
You will be reminded of this at the start of the call and advised that you are under no obligation to disclose any special category data.
