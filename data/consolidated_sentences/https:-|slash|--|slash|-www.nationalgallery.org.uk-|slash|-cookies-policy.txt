Other analytics and metrics tools
Our marketing emails make use of a “Clear Image” (gif) to track, in aggregate, the results of an email campaign
If you wish to turn off this tracking, you can do so by turning off the images in the email itself.
We also may use tools to monitor, in aggregate, the effectiveness of our communications with subscribers to our updates, including email tracking, which records when an email update from the Gallery is opened and/or how many links are clicked within the message.
