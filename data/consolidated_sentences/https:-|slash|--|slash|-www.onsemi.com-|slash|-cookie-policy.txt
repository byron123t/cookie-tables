The advertising networks and/or content providers that deliver ads on our Site may use cookies to
uniquely distinguish your web browser and keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web

Some of these companies may combine information they collect from our Site with other information they
have independently collected relating to your web browser's activities across their network of websites.
These companies collect and use this information under their own privacy policies.
These companies, their privacy policies and the opt-outs they offer can be found in the table below in

Definitions
If you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting on a blog, or participating in
online forums or communities, or when you interact with our Site through social media sites, plug-ins or
other applications, depending upon your privacy settings, this information may become public on the
Internet
We cannot prevent further use of this information
You can control what data you share through
privacy settings available on some social media sites
Please refer to those third party sites’ privacy
policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, which we do not control.
Cookies - A cookie (sometimes referred to as local storage object or LSO) is a data file
placed on a device
Cookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and
technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to as “browser cookies”), HTML5, or Adobe Flash
For
more information on third party cookies that we use for analytics, please review the table in
Section 3 of this Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy.
Web Beacons - Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also
known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our online service’s pages and messages
Web
beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted
into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies
In contrast
to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly
on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Deterministic Finger-printing technologies - If a user can be positively identified across
multiple devices, for instance, because the user has logged into a platform such as Google,
Facebook, Yahoo or Twitter, it can be “determined” who the user is for purposes of improving
customer service.
Probabilistic Finger-printing - Probabilistic tracking depends upon collecting non-personal
data regarding device attributes like operating system, device make and model, IP addresses, ad
requests and location data, and making statistical inferences to link multiple devices to a single
user
Note that this is accomplished through proprietary algorithms owned by the companies
performing probabilistic finger-printing
Note also that in the EU IP Addresses are personal
information.
Device Graph - Device graphs can be created by combining non-personal data regarding use of
smartphones and other devices with personal log-in information to track interactions with content
across multiple devices.
Unique Identifier Header (UIDH) - Unique Identifier Header (UIDH) is the address information
that accompanies Internet (http) requests transmitted over an ISP’s wireless network
For example,
when a customer types on his or her phone the web address of a retailer that request travels over
the network and is delivered to the retailer's website
The information included in that request
includes things like the device type and screen size so that the retailer site knows how to best
display the site on the phone
The UIDH is included in this information, and can be used as an
anonymous way for advertisers to be able to determine that the user is part of a group that a third
party advertiser is attempting to reach
It is important to note that the UIDH is a temporary,
anonymous identifier included with unencrypted web traffic
We change the UIDH on a regular basis to
protect the privacy of our customers
We do not use the UIDH to collect web browsing information and
it does not broadcast individuals' web browsing activity out to advertisers or others.
Embedded Script - An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect
information about your interactions with the online service, such as the links you click on
The
code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service
provider, is active only while you are connected to the online service, and is deactivated or
deleted thereafter.
ETag, or entity tag - A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier
assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL
If the resource content
at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned
Used in this manner ETags are a form
of device identifier
ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer
blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
Unique Device Tokens - For each user that accepts push notifications in mobile apps, the app
developer is provided with a unique device token (think of it as an address) from the app platform
(e.g., Apple and Google).
Unique Device ID - The unique series of numbers and letters assigned to your device
