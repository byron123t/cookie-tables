We’ve updated our Cookies policy
Changes include a new section about Do Not Sell My Personal Information and the California Consumer Privacy Act and updates to the List of Cookies.
This Cookies Policy provides information about the cookies used with this site, pearson.com/en-us.html, which is presented by Pearson Education, Inc., 221 River Street, Hoboken, New Jersey 07030, in collaboration with its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (Pearson)

Do Not Sell My Personal Information and the California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective January 1, 2020, gives California residents the right to opt out of the sale of their Personal Information by a business subject to the law
This law defines “personal information” and “sale” very broadly to include data sharing that does not involve monetary payments and may not include names or email addresses
It is unclear whether third party targeted advertising cookies involve the sale of Personal Information under California law.
Except to the extent that third party targeted advertising cookies constitute a “sale” of personal information under applicable law, we do not sell any Personal Information collected through this site.
