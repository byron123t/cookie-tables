What are cookies and why do we use them?
Cookies and similar technologies (“cookies”) allow small pieces of information to be read from and/or placed onto your device when you visit a website or application
This allows for websites and applications to recognise you or your device on each subsequent visit so that they can remember things like preferences, log in information and saved shopping carts.
Cookies are very useful and do lots of different jobs
For example, they enable you to move between our web pages efficiently, remember your preferences when you visit us again and generally improve your experience when browsing with us
They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests, which in turn help us to tailor our communications.
Cookies last for different lengths of time depending on the job they do
There are session cookies and persistent cookies:
Session cookies only last for your online session and disappear from your device when you close your browser.
Persistent cookies stay on your device after the browser has been closed and last for the period of time specified in the cookie.
You can find information about how Plusnet processes your personal data in our privacy policy.
Your choices
We will only place cookies for the preference level you set
Your preference level will be set depending on the options chosen (usually when you first visit our website), however these can be changed at any time by clicking "Manage Cookie Settings" at the top of this page.
Please note that cookies set before you changed your settings will still be on your device
You can remove them using your browser settings.
Our free online tool can help you manage the cookies we use on plus.net
To use it, your web browser needs to support JavaScript – if it doesn't you can still find out about the cookies we use here, but you'll need to manage them through your web browser settings.
We also use a cookie to remember your cookie preferences
This means if you use a different device, computer profile or browser you will have to tell us your preferences again.
Please note that we may share the information we obtain from cookies with other members of the BT Group
All members of the BT Group provide the same high level of security and protection and will only use information obtained from cookies in accordance with the preferences you set.

Targeting
The core purpose of targeting cookies (otherwise known as advertising cookies) is to provide Plusnet with valuable insights into what our customers want, including but not limited to, insight into the communications and services our customers and potential customers may be interested in.
Disabling targeting cookies, generally does not stop you receiving advertising
It simply means that the advertising you receive is less likely to be aligned with your interests.
In order to gain the insights, in some instances we may analyse your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information relevant to you
This helps to avoid you receiving advertising that is not relevant to you or your interests.
In some instances, we may also use this information to inform us of how well our communications are received by our customers and website users
In order to do this, we may make use of additional information about you when it is available from internal and external sources to help us do this effectively.
These cookies are also linked to services provided to Plusnet and our customers by our trusted partners (see the Third Parties section below for more information)
We/our trusted partners may also share data derived from these cookies with other members of the BT Group for the purpose and provision of the services they provide.
We use Targeting cookies to:
Link to social networks who may use information about your visit to target advertising to you on other websites;
Provide advertising agencies our trusted partners and other members of the BT Group with information on your visit so that we can present adverts that you may be interested in, and prevent you receiving duplicate ads – see the “online behavioural advertising” section below for further details;
Deliver content, including video content, tailored to your interests;
Help us to segment and understand our audience by providing additional information so that we can send the most relevant communications possible;
Help us identify customers similar to our audience or to serve relevant adverts to you on third party websites and apps;
Help us to understand how well our marketing initiatives are performing and whether to continue, change or cease those initiatives
and
To provide tailored communications to you and personalise your use of our website when logged in, and in limited circumstances, when logged out (subject to your preferences).
Online behavioural advertising
We, and our trusted partners (see “Third Parties” section below) use information collected from targeting cookies to collect information about your device and identify your interests by understanding how you interact with our websites, communications and services
We do this so we can tailor advertising we show you on our own and third party sites and apps.
The information we and our trusted partners collect and share through targeting cookies does not directly identify you
It does not include your name or address.
We use your IP address, together with the interests we have assumed based on how you’ve navigated to and how you interact with our websites
For example, if you look at our TV and film packages, we will assume you would like to hear about the latest TV and film offerings we, or our partners, have to offer.
We will also share interest-based advertising information with the third parties that set targeting cookies via our website.
You can opt-out of the use of targeting cookies on our website for online behavioural advertising purposes by blocking and/or deleting these cookies as described below.

Third parties may use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their marketing and services, and to perform services on behalf of Plusnet (as described in the cookie categories above).

You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings (see the Managing Cookies section below).
It is important to note that, although Plusnet and its trusted third party partners will only set cookies in line with your preferences, if you originally accept the use of cookies, but later change your settings, Plusnet and its trusted third party partners may continue to use data collected and derived from cookies during the period of time you consented to the cookie placement.
Managing cookies

Block third party cookies
Block cookies from particular sites
