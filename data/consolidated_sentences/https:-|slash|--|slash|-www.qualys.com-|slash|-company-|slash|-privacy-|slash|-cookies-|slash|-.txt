Cookies We Use
Effective Date: September 28, 2020
This document describes the different types of cookies that may be applied on Qualys Cloud Platform and Cloud Apps ("Cloud Services")
and Qualys websites ("the Site") including www.qualys.com, community.qualys.com, lps.qualys.com, and blog.qualys.com.
This document supplements the Privacy Policy.
Cookie Policy
Our Use of Cookies and Your Options
By using a Qualys Web site with your browser settings adjusted to accept cookies you consent to our use of
cookies and
other tools to provide the products and services available on those sites.
If you would like to modify your browser to
notify you when you receive a new cookie or to disable cookies altogether, please refer to Managing Cookies below.
Cookies and How We Use Them
Cookies are small text files that may be placed on your Web browser when you visit our Web sites or when you view
advertisements, we have placed on other Web sites
Cookies allow your browser to remember some specific information
which the Web server can later retrieve and use
When you quit your browser, some cookies are stored in your
computer’s
memory, while some expire or disappear.
Cookies are used primarily for administrative purposes, to improve your experience with our Web sites
Examples of
this
would include the use of cookies:
To improve site security by “authenticating” you (i.e., verify that you are who you say you are) when you
sign-in to
our site.
To keep track of your specified preferences such as language, time zone and timeouts after periods of
inactivity.
To allow you to navigate our sites more easily by “remembering” your identity so that you do not have to input
your password multiple times as you move between pages or services.
In addition to administrative uses, we may also use cookies in one or more of the following ways, depending on the
Web
site you are using:
To conduct research and analytics to improve our Web sites and our products and services
This includes
compiling
statistical information concerning, among other things, the frequency of your use of our Web sites, the pages
visited
and the length of each visit.
To display Qualys advertisements when you visit Web sites of third parties with whom we have marketing
relationships
and to help us gauge the effectiveness of our advertising efforts
These parties may gather information
concerning your
use of other Web sites and provide us with de-identified information about you (such as demographic information
or the
names of sites where you have been shown ads) which we may use to provide you with more relevant and useful
advertising.
This paragraph applies only to the www.qualys.com Web site
Our site may use
third parties to serve advertisements as
described immediately above
These Cookies may be used to shared data with advertisers so that ads you see are more
relevant and/or are of interest to you, allow you to share certain pages with social networks or allow you to post
comments on our Site.
If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it on the particular device
on
which you are accessing this Privacy and Cookies Policy, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/
For more
information on how we collect and use information that is identifiable to you, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
Managing Cookies
The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,
how
to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether
Additionally,
you
can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings
or
visiting the Web site of its manufacturer
Some of our sites employ “functionality cookies” that help the site
remember
your settings and preferences for use when you visit the site in the future
This provides a more tailored and
pleasant
user experience
These cookies store information in multiple places
On those sites using functionality cookies, you
will find a “Delete Cookies” feature on every page that will allow you to delete these cookies completely from your
device
Please note that, if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality and, for sites
using
authentication-related cookies, declining cookies will prevent you from using the Web site altogether
