Purpose

_hjClosedSurveyInvites
Hotjar cookie that is set once a user interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal
It is used to
ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.
365 days
_hjDonePolls
Hotjar cookie that is set once a user completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget
It is used to
ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in.
365 days
_hjMinimizedPolls
Hotjar cookie that is set once a user minimizes an On-site Survey widget
It is used to ensure that the
widget stays minimized when the user navigates through your site.
365 days
_hjShownFeedbackMessage
Hotjar cookie that is set when a user minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback
This is done so that the
Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the user navigates to another page where it is set to
show.
365 days
_hjSessionTooLarge
Causes Hotjar to stop collecting data if a session becomes too large
This is determined automatically by a
signal from the WebSocket server if the session size exceeds the limit.
Session
_hjid
Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script
It is used to
persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser
This ensures that behavior in subsequent
visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.
365 days
_hjRecordingLastActivity
This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies)
This gets updated when a user recording
starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the user performs an action that Hotjar records).
Session
_hjTLDTest
When the Hotjar script executes it tries to determine the most generic cookie path to use, instead of
the page hostname
This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable)
To
determine this, it stores the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails.
After this check, the cookie is removed.
Session
_hjUserAttributesHash
User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to
know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.
Session
_hjCachedUserAttributes
This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not
in the sample
These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.
Session
_hjLocalStorageTest
This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage
If it can, a value of 1 is
set in this cookie
The data stored in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost
immediately after it is created.
Under 100ms
_hjIncludedInPageviewSample
This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your
site’s pageview limit.
30 minutes
_hjIncludedInSessionSample
This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your
site’s daily session limit.
30 minutes
_hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress
This cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user
This is a True/False flag set by the
cookie.
30 Minutes
_hjFirstSeen
This is set to identify a new user’s first session
It stores a true/false value, indicating whether this was
the first time Hotjar saw this user
It is used by Recording filters to identify new user sessions.
Session
_hjViewportId
This stores information about the user viewport such as size and dimensions.
Session
_hjRecordingEnabled
This is added when a Recording starts and is read when the recording module is initialized to see if the user
is already in a recording in a particular session.
