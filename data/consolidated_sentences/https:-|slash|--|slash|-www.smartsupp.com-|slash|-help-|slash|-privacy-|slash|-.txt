Data privacy & GDPR
DOES SMARTSUPP COMPLY WITH THE GDPR?
Yes, Smartsupp is GDPR compliant.
At Smartsupp, we have really focused on GDPR.
our data is only stored within the EU
This is a big plus because personal data is safe in the EU.
we have our data protection officer, for the protection of personal data Mgr
Petra Stupková, with whom we regularly consult GDPR processing processes (dpo@smartsupp.com)
our Sub-processors of personal data (eg server hosting) are carefully selected with regard to their guarantees of security and data protection
By default, Smartsupp turns off the storage of IP addresses and some other sensitive data when you create your account
You can adjust the settings in your account.
we show visitors to your website a message that personal data is being processed using the Chat box – helping you to fulfill your information obligation;
We have a Personal Data Processing Agreement with all our customers
where you will find details of how the personal data of visitors to your website is processed
It describes what data is processed exactly and how and where it is stored
DO I NEED APPROVAL FROM MY CUSTOMERS WHEN I USE SMARTSUPP?
Smartsupp uses cookies
So it depends on how you use Smartsupp.
I only use a basic version of the chatbot without advanced features – you do not need consent here, as you are processing this data based on your legitimate interest to answer a customer’s query and provide customer support.
I also use “smart” analytics and marketing features – you can’t do without consent here
We recommend that you procure consent with a cookie bar where the user gives explicit consent to analytical and/or marketing cookies (e.g
Allow All).
HOW DO I EDIT MY PROCESSES IF I USE SMARTSUPP?
Privacy Policy:
add “Smartsupp.com, s.r.o., ID No.: 036 68 681, with registered office at Šumavská 31, 602 00 Brno” to the list of processors in your privacy policy
include “We have a legitimate interest to provide customer support, which involves the processing of cookies or other data you enter into the chat box
Personal data in the chat box is processed automatically
Advanced features are only enabled if you have explicitly consented to them using analytics and/or marketing cookies.”
check whether the following personal data that Smartsupp may process for you in the course of operating the Smartsupp service is included in the scope of processing:
Contact details:
– name, surname, email address, phone number, or contact details of a social network account;
Details about visiting your website:
– URL of the websites visited, date and time of the website visit, technical information (screen resolution, device type, browser type, operating system, etc.), IP address, geolocation data (country and city from which the user viewed your website).
Cookies and Local Storage:
When using the Service, new cookies are processed and new data is also stored in Local Storage
An overview of these can be found below.
Check that Smartsupp cookies are included in your cookie overview and are correctly categorised.
Cookies towards your customers:
Functional cookies
Name
Description
Storage
ssupp.vid
The main purpose of this cookie is to identify visitors to your website
Based on this, we can pair the visitor with a conversation when the page is reloaded
As a result, the ongoing conversation does not disappear even after the page is reloaded, so visitors can continue where they left off.
This cookie therefore allows us to display the source, browser information, and number of visits that are listed in the visitor information in the Dashboard.
