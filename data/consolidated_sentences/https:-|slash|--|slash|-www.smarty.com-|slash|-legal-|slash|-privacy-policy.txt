Privacy Policy
Overview
This Privacy Policy governs and describes how SmartyStreets, LLC dba Smarty (herein the "Company," also referred to as "We", "Us" or "Our" herein) may collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain through or from all customers or users (also referred to as "You," "Your" or "Client") regardless of nationality or location when visiting our website or using our service
All personal information that we collect and maintain shall be subject to our Privacy Policy and current laws in effect at the time of collection.
If you have objections to our Privacy Policy, you should not access our Services until modified terms have been agreed to mutually through an addendum to our Terms of Service
If you require special instructions for processing your data, need us to enter into a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), or make modifications to legal terms to protect your privacy, contact us to discuss our Enterprise Solutions.
DEFINITIONS for the purposes of this Privacy Policy:
"Client Account Information" is any information that identifies you as our client, including, but not limited to, a name, email address, location information, Usage Data, account or an identification number, or online identifier.
"Client Data" means the information, and/or input data, including an address or any other Personal information contained therein, in any form or media, that is (i) submitted or entered into the Company's cloud based system or Site by Client or on behalf of Client or its end users
(ii) accessed or used by Company in providing any Services to Client
or (iii) data and content collected, compiled, inferred, stored, cached, or derived directly or indirectly from any of the data and content described in subclauses (i) and (ii) herein.
"Consumer" means a natural person who is a California resident as defined by California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").
"Data Controller" refers to you as the legal person or entity which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of processing Personal Information
You are responsible and accountable for the use of Personal Information of Data Subjects and Consumers in your possession.
"Data Processor" refers to us as your Service Provider, who processes Personal Information only on your behalf or instruction as the Data Controller.
"Data Subject" refers to any person residing in the European Union ("EU") whose Personal Information is being collected, held, or processed as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") .
"Enhanced Data Privacy" also commonly referred to as "incognito mode" is an optional feature in the Platform that Client may elect to purchase that prevents Client Data and or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from ever being logged at the point of submission or Provider's APIs
Client Data submissions are accessed only momentarily in Random Access Memory (RAM), just long enough to process and deliver results back to Client
Upon completion of the process, any residual Client Data in the system's RAM is dumped or "garbage collected" and written over by subsequent transactions
Such processing methods render data deletion, destruction, correction, blocking, or exportation back to Client not feasible due to the nature of the transitory process.
"Personal Information" or "Personal Identifiable Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate a person, Consumer or Data Subject to whom such information pertains
(It may refer to Client Data such as the list of addresses of individuals you are seeking to validate or verify).
"Services" means subscription to or use of Company's software products, APIs, and/or Website.
"Service Provider" refers to us as the Data Processor analyzing Personal Information against our authoritative database to provide you the requested Services.
"Share" or "Sell" means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a Data Subject's or Consumer's Personal Information to another business or a third-party for monetary or other consideration.
"Usage Data" refers to data collected automatically when you access any of our services either through the use of the Service or generated from the infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a website visit).

What are cookies?

Cookies do not hold any information to identify an individual person, but are instead used to identify a browser on an individual machine.
If you prefer, you can restrict, block, or delete cookies by changing your browser settings, but that may mean that our website won't work properly.
