COOKIE NOTICE OF SRS ACQUIOM INC.
October 3, 2022
This Cookie Notice applies to SRS Acquiom Inc
(“SRS Acquiom” or “we”) and its related affiliates, and our websites at srsacquiom.com (“Websites“)
This Cookie Notice explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit the Websites, why we use them and rights to control our use of them.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer’s hard drive
A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier
A cookie also may contain information about your computer, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using the Websites
To learn more about cookies generally, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, SRS Acquiom) are called first-party cookies
Cookies set by any other party are called third-party cookies
Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality on or through the Websites, such as interactive content and analytics
The parties that set third-party cookies can recognize your browser both when it visits the Websites and when it visits certain other websites.
This website uses cookies to remember visitors and optimize site functionality
Some cookies are necessary, while others help us to understand how the site is being used
The information does not directly identify you and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to.
This website uses cookies, including Google Analytics, to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve its performance
The cookie providers may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process information on the cookie providers’ behalf
The cookie providers will not associate your IP address with any other data held by the cookie provider.
You can choose not to allow certain types of cookies
However, you cannot opt out of our Necessary Cookies, as they are deployed to ensure the proper functioning of our website (such as prompting the cookie banner and remembering your settings)
By using the services and tools provided through SRS Acquiom Clearinghouse®, SRS Acquiom ComPort® (Shareholder Representative Portal), SRS Acquiom MarketStandard®, SRS Acquiom Deal Dashboard, SRS Acquiom Workspaces, SRS Acquiom Virtual Data Room or SRS Acquiom Private Client Portal (including any white labelled version thereof used or accessed via a third party custom domain), you accept the cookies that are placed in connection with your use of such services and tools and are intentionally directing SRS Acquiom or its affiliates to make your cookie data available to our third party partners to optimize your experience and  support the functionality of such services and tools, consistent with your expectations under applicable privacy and data protection laws
These cookies are critical to the performance and proper functioning of such services and tools and accordingly, are considered Necessary Cookies
As such, you cannot opt out of the placement of such cookies
You further acknowledge that we have a legitimate interest in placing such cookies in connection with your use of such services and tools.
Cookie Settings
Below you can learn more about the cookies we use.
Necessary Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the website/application to function and cannot be switched off in our systems
They are usually set in response to actions made by a user in a request for services, such as logging in or filling in a form.
Recommended Cookies
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve performance of our site and applications
They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site(s)
All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous
If you do not allow these cookies, we will be less able to optimize our Websites’ performance.
Marketing Cookies
These cookies may be set through our site by advertising partners
They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites
These cookies do not directly store personal information, but can uniquely identify information such as your browser and device.
SRS Acquiom may use other tracking technologies, like web beacons.
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website
We may use other data collection technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”)
A web beacon is computer code that contains a unique identifier that enables us to monitor user activity and traffic of the Websites
This other data collection technology enables SRS Acquiom to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page on the Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve performance of the Websites and to measure the success of our email marketing campaigns
This other data collection technology relies on cookies to function properly, which means that declining cookies will impair the functioning.
How can you control cookies?
You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies
You can set your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies
You also may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device.
If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use the Websites, but some areas may be restricted or not properly function
To learn how to manage your cookies, please follow the instructions from your specific browser.
If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com
SRS Acquiom may periodically update this Cookie Notice.
We may update this Cookie Notice from time to time in order to reflect changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons
Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Notice regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
The Effective Date at the top of this Cookie Notice indicates when it was last updated.
Where can I get more information?
If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please contact SRS Acquiom at Privacy@srsacquiom.com
