Cookie Notice
We are the publishing group Banyan Tree Infomedia LLP
In this Notice we will refer to the mobile
applications as Apps and use the term Sites to refer to our websites.
The information generated from your browsing, helps us to understand how people use our
websites, how we can improve them and also make sure advertisers get a good return on their
investment
Their advertising funds our activities and the content you read for free.
Like most websites and mobile applications, we use automatic data collection technology when you
visit one of our Sites or use one of our Apps
This notice explains how we use so called “cookies” and
other related technologies and how you can manage the behaviour of these cookies.
There is a detailed description of how we use the data we collect in our Privacy Notice please click here.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files sent from a website to your web browser
They are stored in your web
browser’s cache and allow a website or a third party to recognise your browser or mobile device.
Mobile devices and browsers can be shared by a number of people, so cookies are not always wholly
related to individuals.
We use three major types of cookies:
Analytics Cookies hold information as you view different pages of the website and help us to build
up a profile of how our readers use the website
They help us to make the website work as
efficiently as possible and provide better content and services in the future
We may also use
analytics cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising on the Sites and the Apps and
elsewhere on the internet.
Personalisation and Service Cookies remember your computer or mobile device when you visit a
website
They remember your registration and login details and your settings and preferences
They
are used to ensure you don’t have to login every time you use your browser to comment on articles
and to ensure interactive services work effectively
They are also used to recommend content we
think you'll be interested in, based on what you've looked at before.
Example: When you vote for movies and people on our Sites, we will use cookies to prevent a device
or browser voting hundreds of times to influence the poll results.
Advertising Cookies are placed by us and our advertising partners to deliver more relevant
advertising
Our Sites, Apps and services are predominately free to consume, and in exchange we
sell our advertising space to allow us to create high quality content and bring you the services you
value
Cookies are a vital part of that value exchange.
These cookies may gather information about your browsing activity on our sites and for third parties,
across different Sites and across different visits
They allow us and advertisers to show more relevant
ads and allow advertisers to manage how many times a device sees an advert
They might also allow
the advertiser to tailor advertising to you when you visit our Sites
Advertising Cookies are usually
stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time period set in each cookie, which is
normally around 30 days.
The third party advertisers are required to follow the applicable laws
However, Banyan Tree
Infomedia LLP does not have control over the third party organisations that place cookies, who each
have their own cookie and privacy policies
We aim to be transparent on who we work with
You can
find a list of our partners and option to control advertising cookies in our cookie management tool
here.
If you opt out of Advertising cookies, you are not opting out of seeing advertising! You will still see
plenty of adverts
They just may not be as relevant to you and your interests
See ‘Manage Cookies’
below for more information about “opting out”.
