It is Tufts’ policy to hold all personal information you supply in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy law.
Information Gathered About You or Your Devices
We collect information when you access one of the Services and when you subscribe to our email services.
Device Information
We may collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Services such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature
We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Services.
IP Address
Your IP address is automatically assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider
An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited
Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services
We use IP addresses for several purposes, such as security, calculating usage levels, and diagnosing server problems
We also use your IP address to administer our Services by identifying (1) which parts of a Service are most heavily used, (2) where our users come from (i.e., a referring sign or a search engine, etc.), and (3) which portion of our audience comes from within or outside the Tufts network
We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address
We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable unless we are required to do so under applicable law or court order or authorized to do so under our policies.
Physical Location
We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content
We may also share your device’s physical location with our service providers to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns
In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our service providers may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.
Use of Cookies
Cookies are small files that are stored on your device and are used to collect and store information
This may include: which pages you see
how long you stay
what you click on our pages
if you visit the website again
and which country and city you are browsing from.
Types of Cookies
A session cookie is temporary, linking the actions of a user during any given browser session
When the browser is closed, the cookie is deleted
A permanent cookie, also known as a persistent cookie, is stored for a specific period of time and activates each time the user visits the website that created the cookie
A third-party cookie is placed by a domain other than that of the website the user is visiting
Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.
Why we use Cookies
We use session, permanent and third-party cookies for security purposes, to display information more effectively, to understand and save your preferences for future visits and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction, so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future
Cookies further allow us to select which of our programs, initiatives, offerings and services are most likely to appeal to you and to display them while you are on the Services.
We may contract with selected third parties to place cookies through the Services to provide us with better insights into the use of the Services or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you
These third parties may collect information about a user’s online activities over time and across different websites when they use our Services
These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
Some third-party cookies may originate from websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest or other social media services
Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly.
Use of Technology to Track Users of ServicesGoogle Analytics
One or more of our Services may also use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to track website statistics
Google Analytics uses cookies and other technologies to track visitor interactions and collects the IP address of website visitors in order to provide us a sense of where our visitors come from
This service may also collect demographic and information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources
Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors or reporting IP addresses to us.
We use the information collected to understand how our visitors are using the website and make improvements for a better online experience
We do not use Google Analytics to track or collect personal information (name, email address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information) and we do not associate personal information with web analytics information.
To see the full Google Analytics privacy policy and learn more about its privacy practices, please see Google Privacy Policy, www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and Google Analytics: Safeguarding Your Data
You can opt out of the services by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Pixel Tags
One or more of our Services may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons, tags or clear GIFs) that embed graphic files in our Services
These graphic files contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Services, or, in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them.
These small data files or graphic files serve a variety of functions
In some instances, they may be necessary to deliver a particular service
Even when they are not essential to the delivery of a service, they may provide information that enables us to improve the performance and functionality of our services and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns
They may also enable us to customize our services and provide advertising messages that are more relevant to you and your interests.

Interest-Based Advertisements
Some of our Services engage in online interest-based advertising to enhance your experience and show you advertisements that might interest you
Like many organizations, we and our advertising partners display tailored interest-based advertising on the Services and on third-party platforms using information you make available to us when you interact with our Services
Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as searching on our Services or visiting other websites, apps or online services that contain our content or ads
We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like mobile identifiers, cookies, and pixel tags.

Google provides information on Blocking Certain Ads and on how to Control the Ads You See

Also, note that deleting browser cookies can remove the cookie preferences you have made, so you may need to opt-out again in the future.

Why have I been directed to this webpage?
The general information published on this page is intended to supplement specific information that you may have already been given in connection with your engagement with a particular service, facility, event or initiative run by Tufts
You may have been directed here, for example, because you are accessing an optional staff or student service or using a Tufts facility, or because you are using a particular website or online resource, or because you have signed up to attend an event aimed at prospective students or members of the public
The information below is the same for many such situations, and we thought it would be helpful to have it in one place.
2
What is “personal data” and what does “processing” mean?
In this notice and in the other specific notices, we use the broad meaning of personal data used in the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR, which define “personal data” as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
Other Privacy Laws may include other definitions of personal information or personal data, which may be narrower than this definition or may include very specific types of information.
Many of the Privacy Laws use the word “processing.” “Processing” simply means any way of working with personal data, from collecting it to using it to sharing it to disposing of it.
3
What are the purposes and lawful bases for processing your personal data?
Tufts may collect, use and otherwise process personal data about you for several different purposes and legal bases, including:
We need it to perform a contract with you, such as to provide you services.
It satisfies a legitimate interest, such as to promote and provide goods and services to you and to protect our legal rights and interests
When our purpose is based on our legitimate interest, we consider whether that interest is overridden by your data protection interests.
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
We need to process your data in connection with your or another person’s vital interest.
We need to process your data in connection with the public interest.
We have another permitted legal basis.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose under the EEA GDPR or the UK GDPR, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose under another of the Privacy Laws, then that Privacy Law may also allow you to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
Unless you are told otherwise, there is no requirement to supply us with any of your personal data
It is Tufts’ policy to not use personal data to carry out any automated decision-making that affects you without an appropriate legal basis as required by the applicable Privacy Law.
Specific information for Services
Tufts will process your personal data in connection with tufts.edu and other Tufts University websites (together, a “Site” or “Sites”) that have pointed you to this page, as well as mobile apps and other digital properties (together, a “Service” or the “Services”), for a variety of service- and business-related purposes, including for analyzing and improving website performance
email and other communications
processing you have requested
third-party services
and security and legal requirements.
The use of your personal data in the manner described above and elsewhere in the Privacy Statement are necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its Services, analyzing their use, and ensuring their security
The Services collect limited personal data and we use it in ways that are compatible with your individual rights and freedoms
Where you enter your personal data into an online form on or in connection with any of our Services for any specified purpose, you will be told about the use we will make of that information (e.g., to send you newsletters or to enable your attendance at an event).
4
If I am outside of the United States, will my personal data be transferred out of the country where I am located or reside?
Your personal data will be transferred out of the country where you are when it is collected to the USA, which has different privacy laws than those of your country
Your personal data may also be transferred to countries other than the US, which may have different privacy laws than those of your country
Tufts has adopted appropriate measures to protect your personal data
The transfer of your personal data may be necessary for the performance of a contract between you and Tufts, for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest, or for important reasons in the public interest
In limited circumstances, the transfer may be necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, to protect your vital interests, or as otherwise permitted by the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR, or other applicable Privacy Laws.
5
Will Tufts share my personal data with others?
We will use reasonable measures to ensure that your personal data are only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the standard of protection required under the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR, or other Privacy Laws, as applicable.
6
How long will my personal data be kept?
Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at Records Retention Schedules.
7
What rights do I have with respect to my personal data?
The Privacy Laws of different countries provide specific data protection rights
It is Tufts’ intention to comply with the data protection rights that apply to its processing of personal data under the different Privacy Laws.
Rights Provided by the EEA GDPR and the >UK GDPR
The EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR provide individuals with several specific data protection rights with respect to their personal data
These rights require a particular type of connection to the countries that are part of the EEA or the UK
These rights apply when Tufts processes your personal data:
As part of Tufts acting in an established way in the EEA or UK, respectively,
In connection with Tufts offering goods or services to you when you are physically in the EEA or the UK, or
When the processing is related to any monitoring of your behavior when you are physically in the EEA or UK.
The rights provided by the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR are generally described below
Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to Make a Subject Access Request
These rights are not absolute and each right is subject to limitations.
The right of access
You have the right to confirmation of the personal data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information
Among the limitations for this right is that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
The right to correct
You have a right to have inaccurate personal data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)
You have a right to have your personal data erased in certain limited circumstances.
The right to restrict processing and to object to use
You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your personal data
This right only applies in certain circumstances
If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions
Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
The right to data portability
The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your personal data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services
This right allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another
This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
The right to object
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.
Rights Provided under other Privacy Laws
As mentioned above, it is Tufts’ intention to comply with the data protection rights that apply to its processing of personal data under the different Privacy Laws
If you wish to exercise a data protection right under one of the Privacy Laws other than the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR, then you can find additional information at How to make a Subject Access Request.

Where can I go if I have questions?
If you have any questions about how your personal data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights with respect to your personal data, please see How to Make a Subject Access Request or contact Tufts’ Data Privacy Team at dataprivacy@tufts.edu.
If you are not happy with the way your personal data is being handled, or with the response received from us, then the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR provide you the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority or commissioner in the country where you habitually reside, where you work, or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.

How to Make a Subject Access Request
This document provides information about how to submit a request to exercise rights you have with respect to your personal data under privacy laws and regulations (together, the Privacy Laws).
Rights provided by the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR
Among the Privacy Laws that provide specific rights with respect to an individual’s personal data are the General Data Protection Regulation for the European Economic Area (EEA) (the EEA GDPR) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, as tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018 of the UK (the UK GDPR).
Tufts' Global Privacy Statement for Personal Data describes when the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR provide rights applying to an individual’s personal data
For example, if you provide personal data to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or the UK, or while you participate in an established Tufts program that occurs in the EEA or UK, then you would have the following rights under the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR:
The right of access.
The right to correct.
The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten).
The right to restrict processing.
The right to data portability (to move the data to another party).
The right to object.
All of these rights are subject to certain exemptions and limitations
More information about these rights may be found in the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR and in the Global Privacy Statement for Personal Data.
Rights provided under other Privacy Laws
Other Privacy Laws may provide you with certain rights with respect to your personal data
Please be aware that some Privacy Laws do not apply to non-profit institutions
Generally, a Privacy Law will require you to have a specific relationship to the jurisdiction in order to be entitled to exercise a personal data right.
Form for Submitting a Request
Requesting to exercise your rights under the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR, the PIPL or another Privacy Law is known as making a Subject Access Request (sometimes called an SAR)
A Subject Access Request form is made available for your convenience
The form sets out where you should send your request and asks that you provide us with proof of your identity.
Before we can act on your request, we must:
Confirm your identity
Be supplied with sufficient information from you in order to locate the information you seek.
On receipt of your completed request, verification of your identity, and sufficient details to enable us to locate the information, we will endeavor to provide you information on our actions promptly
The EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR require that we act on a completed request within one month
That period may be extended by two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.
If we determine not to fulfill your request, we are required to notify you within one month of our reasons for not doing so.
If a person’s data requests are clearly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs or decline to act on the requests.

“Tufts” in this context means the central university, our individual schools, departments and research institutes, and the libraries and other cultural and recreational facilities that we operate
Developing a better understanding of our alumni, donors and other supporters allows us to keep in touch with you, in order to keep you apprised of our activities and developments, to provide services to you, and to identify ways in which you can support us, through donations or other forms of financial and non-financial support.

Personal data held by Tufts
We may hold information relating to you from a number of sources
A significant proportion of the personal data we hold on alumni, donors and supporters is provided to us directly (for example, an alumnus may give us information by filling in forms on the Tufts website, or by corresponding with us by telephone, email or otherwise)
If you are a student or studied at Tufts, some of your personal information is transferred from your student record to Tufts University Advancement databases.
The information we hold about you may or may not be personal data within the scope of the EEA GDPR, the UK GDPR or other Privacy Laws
Among the information records may contain are:

Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” personal data are managed very carefully.

How your personal data is used by Tufts
We may use automated or manual analyses to link personal data together to help us identify your potential for supporting Tufts, to provide you with an improved experience, to send you communications which are relevant and timely, to identify volunteering opportunities or opportunities for providing support which may be of interest to you, and to avoid approaching you with opportunities which are not of interest
All of this enables us to raise more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, in support of Tufts’ strategic research and teaching objectives
We always seek to ensure that any opportunities we present are aligned with your interests, based on the research we conduct.
Your personal data is used by us for a number of interdependent purposes in support of alumni relations, communications and fundraising
These include:
sending you publications, alumni magazines, and news and updates about Tufts
conducting surveys, including research on when and whether particular donations or funding appeals may be of interest to you
providing services, including access to Tufts facilities and alumni and donor email accounts
providing an alumni directory within the password-protected Tufts University Online community
sending you information about giving opportunities, tailored proposals, appeals and requests for donations
sending you details of volunteering opportunities
inviting you to alumni, donor, and other Tufts events
the promotion of other opportunities and services available to you (e.g
offers and opportunities available through Tufts’ network of alumni, donor and supporter groups)
wealth analysis and research in order to improve our understanding of our alumni, donors and supporters, inform our fundraising strategy and target our communications more effectively
internal record keeping, including the management of any feedback or complaints
administrative purposes (e.g
in order to process a donation you have made or to administer an event you have registered for or attended)
The Tufts University Alumni Association and the Tufts University Advancement Division has also occasionally approved sharing alumni, donor and supporter data with companies and institutions that desire to offer services and benefits to Tufts alumni, donors and supporters at a discounted rate
Any third parties who receive alumni, donor and supporter data for this purpose are prohibited from using or sharing the data for any purpose other than providing services to Tufts or to its alumni, donors and supporters.
Communications to you may be sent by mail, telephone or electronic means, depending on the contact details we hold and the preferences expressed by you about the types of communications you wish to receive
Alumni may at any time opt-out of receiving all emails from the alumni association, or just emails from companies and institutions offering services and benefits to alumni, by clicking on the “update your email subscription preferences” link in emails and following the specified instructions, or by calling 1-800-THE- ALUM (1-800-843-2586) or 617-627-3532, by faxing a request to 617-627-3938, or by mailing a request to Tufts University Alumni Association, 80 George St., Ste

Tufts’ schools offer many programs that provide engaging educational experiences without requiring the participants to commit to seeking a degree
Our non-degree educational programs include online, on campus and/or other in person sessions

Executive education programs

Educational programs, lessons, or camps for middle school, elementary, and pre-k students
Courses offered to learners who are not receiving academic credit toward a degree, that may also be offered for credit to students enrolled in degree programs
Special, focused programs offered to learners, but that do not grant credit toward a Tufts academic degree
Programs offered off campus that include travel to places around the world
This statement provides notice under the laws and regulations that include notice and other requirements that may apply to your personal data (together, the Privacy Laws)
Among those Privacy Laws are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA) (regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament) (the EEA GDPR) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, as tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018 of the UK (the UK GDPR)
