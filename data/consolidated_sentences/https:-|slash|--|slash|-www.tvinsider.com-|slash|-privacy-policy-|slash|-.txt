1.3.1 Tracking Technologies TV Insider LLC and our service providers or other third parties acting on our behalf or with our permission, may use embedded scripts, cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other tracking technologies to operate, analyze and improve our Services and tailor content and advertising to user interests
Third-party companies that provide some of the tools and features accessible through our Services and advertisers and other companies involved in the delivery of advertisements you see on our Services and other websites also may use tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our Services
A “cookie” is a small text file (often containing a unique identifier) that helps us to make your use of our Services more enjoyable and meaningful to you
Cookies are accessed and recorded by the websites you visit, and by the companies that deliver the advertisements you see on our Services, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online
Cookies can also help you avoid having to log in every time you come back to use the Services
They also allow us to tailor a website, application or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences
There are a couple different types of cookies
A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory and lasts only for your browsing session
When you close all of your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever
A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now
Persistent cookies stay on your computer until they either, a) expire
b) are overwritten with newer cookies
or c) you manually remove them
Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies
This may, however, prevent you from having access to some site functions or features
Your browser can also notify you when a cookie is set
(Check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) Please be aware that certain browsers cannot block or delete so-called “Flash” cookies, which use a feature of the Adobe Flash video player to store information on your computer
For information about how to delete Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe website here
The Services may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags, which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not
and if so, how many times
In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon, which is a small string of code that embeds a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email or advertisement
When your browser downloads a web beacon, the server that sends the corresponding image to your browser can recognize and store certain types of information such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page embedded with the beacon and a description of that page
1.3.2 Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information When you use a mobile device to access the Services, TV Insider LLC may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based location information)
TV Insider LLC may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features
For example, if your IP address indicates an origin in Detroit, the Services may be customized with Detroit-specific information and advertisements
The ads in our apps may be targeted to you based on your current GPS location, or they may be targeted to you based on your zip code or device’s IP address
In order to do this, your location information may be shared with our agents, vendors or advertisers
If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device automatically to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this
See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details
We may still ask for a zip code or other location information
1.3.3 Social Network Posting Tools and “Share” Features TV Insider LLC offers social network posting and sharing tools through the Services, including a “share” button that allows you to post links to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others on your social network pages
