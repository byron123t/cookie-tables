Please note that this Privacy Policy, except for the portions of this Privacy Policy describing the collection of information through this Site, does not cover the privacy practices of USTA sections or districts, which operate independently
USTA sections and districts may collect, use and share your personal information in different ways from those described in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use and disclosure of information that we may collect from and about you
Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this Site.

If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children, we will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C
6501 et seq.)
The Internet offers children wonderful educational and entertainment resources
Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience
We encourage you to visit the Direct Marketing Association’s Web site (www.the-dma.org) and explore the Get CyberSavvy! Program as well as the GetNetWise Web site (www.getnetwise.org) to learn more about parental control tools

In order to access some of the services, applications or sweepstakes offered by the USTA, you may be required to register and/or provide personal information, such as name, email, telephone number and birthdate (“Registration Data”)
Although information may be required to participate in certain activities or promotions, participants provide that information voluntarily.
By registering, you agree to: (i) provide true, accurate and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form
and (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete
You acknowledge and agree the USTA shall have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to maintain accurate Registration Data, including, but not limited to, your failure to receive critical information about the site or any mobile service or your account
You further agree the USTA is authorized to verify such Registration Data through its own records as well as those of third parties

ITF World Tennis Number
The ITF World Tennis Number (WTN) provides a global standard for players
It is a 40-1 scale, with 40 being a beginner player and 1 being an elite professional
This scale is for all players, regardless of age, gender, or ability
Players will have separate ITF World Tennis Numbers for singles and doubles
ITF World Tennis Number was developed by the International Tennis Federation (ITF)
The ITF is the international governing body of tennis that works with national associations worldwide to support the growth of the sport
For more information on USTA’s participation with the World Tennis Number see (https://www.usta.com/en/home/organize/program-resources/national/itf-world-tennis-number.html).
Participation in USTA, ITF, and additional USTA partner events will count toward a player’s WTN rating
Players must have match results in order to generate an initial rating
Your WTN rating may appear on USTA.com, TennisLink.com, and additional USTA properties as well as on worldtennisnumber.com, and third party tennis sites who are licensed to do so
Worldtennisnumber.com is owned and operated by the ITF and is governed by ITF privacy notices which can be found at: https://www.itftennis.com/en/about-us/privacy-notices/?type=privacy-notices.

Controlling and Deleting Cookies
If you would like to change how a browser uses cookies, including blocking or deleting cookies from the Site you can do so by changing the settings in your web browser
To control cookies, most browsers allow you to either accept or reject all cookies, only accept certain types of cookies, or prompt you every time a site wishes to save a cookie
It’s also easy to delete cookies that are already saved on your device by a browser.
The processes for controlling and deleting cookies vary depending on which browser you use
To find out how to do so with a particular browser, you can use your browser’s “Help” function or alternatively, you can visit http://www.aboutcookies.org, which explains, step-by-step, how to control and delete cookies in most browsers.
