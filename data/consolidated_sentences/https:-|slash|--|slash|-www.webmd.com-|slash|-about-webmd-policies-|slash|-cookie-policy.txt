Persistent cookies are stored on your browser or mobile device until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically delete themselves at expiration.Third-party cookies are placed by someone other than WebMD, and may gather browsing activity across multiple websites and sessions
They are usually persistent cookies and are stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time period set in each third-party cookie."Web Beacons" are graphic image files embedded in a page of a website typically used to monitor activity on the page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the Web Beacon is located, the type of browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any cookies on your computer previously placed by that server."Application SDKs" are mobile application third-party software development kits that are embedded in mobile applications

We work with third party ad networks to display advertising on the WebMD Sites and on third party sites
Our ad network vendors use technologies to collect information about your activities on the WebMD Sites and our flagship WebMD App to provide you cookie-based targeted advertising based upon your browsing activity and your interests
The specific providers we use are subject to change, however below is a list of some of our current ad network partners:DirectAmazonAppNexusFacebookGoogleIndex ExchangeLive IntentMedia.NetPubMaticRubiconSharethroughTeadsTrustx Resellers Through Media.netBrealtimeConversant MediaDistrict MLijitOpenXPulsepointSovrnSpotX Because your browser, App, or device communicates with these third parties respective servers, these companies can collect information, including your IP address, page header information, browser or device information, just as if you had requested their website or used their apps directly
These companies may collect information to deliver you customized ads on both the WebMD Sites and non-WebMD websites, applications, and services
In some situations, WebMD may interact with these companies outside of your browser or device, directly between our web servers
Many of these third parties offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites
Please review each company’s privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you
We encourage you to periodically review this Cookie Policy for the latest information on our ad network partners.Your ChoicesMost browser software can be set to reject cookies, and offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" or "Settings" or "Preferences" section of your browser’s toolbar
If you reject our cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of our websites may not work properly but you do not have to accept our cookies in order to productively use most features of our websites
It is important to note that in order to use the opt-out services described below, such as the Network Advertising Initiative and the TRUSTed Ads™ program, you must not reject all cookies because these opt-out procedures work by placing cookies on your browser that enable these opt-out procedures to function
The "opt-out cookies" are placed, for example, in order to help prevent the placement of Cookies used for the targeting of advertising..Certain companies that serve ads allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of cookies
In order to do so, you must opt-out of such data collection with each individual site
You can also opt out of cookies for several ad servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site
This website will also allow you to review the privacy policies of these ad servers
You can find additional information and resources about how to opt out of advertising and related cookies by visiting the World Privacy Forum's Site
If you are located in the European Union (EU), you may also opt-out here
In order to give you more control over your privacy choices WebMD has implemented a DAA (Digital Advertising Alliance) approved opt-out mechanism for interest-based advertising
At the bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites you will see an AdChoices logo (which looks like this: )
In our general WebMD App you can find the AdChoices option in the “Settings” screen
By clicking on that logo on the WebMD Sites or following the instructions in the general WebMD App, you will be presented with a window that will identify all of the companies that WebMD uses to direct tailored advertisements to you, both on the WebMD Sites and general WebMD App as well as on third-party sites
If you would like to stop this tailored advertising from WebMD, you can manage these advertisements through the choices in that window
Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic advertisements through the Services
Please note that your choice to stop tailored advertising is specific to the browser or mobile device that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from one computer or mobile device and you want your opt-out to apply to a different computer or mobile device as well please opt out from that computer or mobile device too
By clicking the + symbol next to the name of a vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that vendor assists us with the delivery of advertisements
The WebMD Sites do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals
This opt-out mechanism is also available in the general WebMD App for iOS and Android, as well as on our mobile optimized sites, but is not currently available on our other Apps (WebMD Pregnancy, WebMD Baby and WebMD Allergy).You may also control interest-based advertising on your mobile device by enabling the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting in your iOS device’s settings or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in your Android device’s settings
This will not prevent you from seeing advertisements, but will limit the use of device advertising identifiers to personalize ads based on your interests
If you have questions about how to reject Cookies on your specific device please check with the device manufacturer.Additional Information for WebMD’s Visitors from the European Economic Area (“EEA”)If you are a WebMD user in the EEA, before cookies are placed on your computer or device, you will be shown a banner requesting that you either accept or decline the placement of cookies
By accepting the placement of cookies you are enabling us to provide the best possible experience and service to you
